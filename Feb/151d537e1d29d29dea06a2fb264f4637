By Laleye Dipo The officials of the Niger State Government have for the first time met with the parents of the student that was slayed by the bandits during the invasion of the Government Science College Kagara that led to the abduction of 27 students. The slayed student that was identified as Benjamin B Habila was shot dead last Wednesday when he tried to escape from the bandits that stormed their hostel. The government delegation was led by the Commissioner for Education Mrs. Hannatu Jibrin Salihu, and included her counterpart in the Ministry of Mineral Resources, Mr. Sunday Emmanuel and the Director General Religious Affairs, Mr. Umar Farouk, as well as some school principals. A statement on the visit from the government delegation revealed that Salihu met the father of the deceased student, Mr. Ayuba Danasabe Bawa, at his residence in Kagara. She described the deceased student as “a hero” and asked the father to take his demise as an act of God, assuring him that the government would doing everything possible to ensure that the other abducted students “are rescued safely and returned to their parents as soon as possible.” Responding, the father of the deceased student reportedly expressed gratitude to the government for the visit and the “gift given to him.” Bawa was quoted as saying that the death of his son will not deter him from sending his other children to school. Prayers were later offered for the repose of the soul of the deceased student. Meanwhile talks that could lead to the release of the other abducted continued throughout Sunday without breakthrough. However, the commuters in a state government’s vehicle that were kidnapped a week ago were released and received on Sunday at government house by the Niger State Governo, Mr.r Abubakar Sani Bello, who said the victims will undergo vigorous medical checks before being handed over to their loved ones.
