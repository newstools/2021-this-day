CAF CONFEDERATION CUP Duro Ikhazuagbe A 59th minute lone strike by Cyril Olisema made the difference as hosts Enyimba FC gained a slim advantage over Rivers United in the first leg of their CAF Confederation Cup playoff match in Aba yesterday evening. The clash between two of Nigeria’s arguably best teams of the moment was disrupted with only 10 minutes played by a heavy down pour. Algerian centre referee Mehdi Abid Chidef who had earlier called off the game recalled both teams to continue play after assessing the state of the Aba Stadium turf. Enyimba were reduced to 10 men in the 75th minute, when striker Tosin Omoyele was sent off. The home team dominated the tie, but could not make their dominance to count with more goals. The visitors chased the game in the closing moments. The loss in Aba has denied Rivers United a N20 million bonus promised the team by The state’s chief executive. The reverse fixture next week in Port Harcourt promises to be a winner takes all. The overall winners of this matchup will advance to the money-spinning stage of the Confederation Cup.
