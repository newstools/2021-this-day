Former National Publicity Secretary of the Nigerian Bar Association ( NBA), Mr. John Austin Unachukwu, last week in Lagos, described the former Governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Kayode Jakande as a selfless leader who should be emulated by all. Mr. Unachukwu stated this when he led a delegation of the 1992/94 set of the Nigerian Institute of Journalism (NIJ) on a condolence visit, to commiserate with the family over the demise of the former Lagos helmsman. Receiving the delegation on behalf of the family, Hon. Deji Jakande who is a member of the class, expressed gratitude that the class could come together to visit and condole with him and the family at this trying time. He urged the group, to extend his greetings to other members of the class. In his Speech, John Austin stated that the late Lateef Kayode Jakande was a servant-leader, who lived a modest life among his people, and gave his all for the wellbeing and good of his people. Promoting the greatest happiness of the greatest majority, was his philosophy and driving force. “I am a great beneficiary of his good leadership and infrastructural development, in Lagos State. Apart from attending the NIJ in which he was a critical stakeholder, I also attended the Lagos State University, where I enjoyed scholarship to obtain my Law degrees. The University was built under his regime, and today, we are proud of being greatest Lasuites. “I urge everybody to uphold and sustain the values and principles for which he lived, this is the only way to immortalise this great statesman. The family should take solace in the fact that, Baba is alive in the minds of people too numerous to mention”, Unachukwu stated.
