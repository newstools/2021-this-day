By Ndubuisi Francis In a move to woo investors, the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) is billed to hold an international investorsâ€™ webinar designed to showcase investment opportunities in four enterprises slated for concession. The webinar, which holds on February 23, 2021, would centre around Tafawa Balewa Trade Fair Complex, Lagos; Lagos International Trade Fair Complex (LITFC), Calabar Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and Kano Special Economic Zone (SEZ). The webinar aligns with the new mandate of the BPE as contained in a new federal government circular which effectively gives the Bureau the responsibility for the concession of public enterprises and infrastructure already listed in the First and Second Schedules of the Public Enterprises Act; and acting on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) as the counterparty on all infrastructure projects being developed on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis. A statement issued by the Bureau, Sunday, said the one-day webinar will provide a platform for prospective investors to leverage on the vast opportunities in the four enterprises in line with international best practices. The virtual event is expected to attract foreign embassies, high commissions, trade missions, multilateral and bilateral commissions, identified investors, ministries, state governors, sister agencies and the Presidency. The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Adeniyi Adebayo, is expected to give the keynote address.
