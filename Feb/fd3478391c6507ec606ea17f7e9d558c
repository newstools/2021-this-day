Rebecca Ejifoma A leading telecommunications firm, Briclinks Africa Plc, was on Thursday listed in the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) as the first internet service provider company on the Growth Board of the NSE. The approval for the listing of the company’s shares was secured over the weekend.
Briclinks’ Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Mr. Paul Nwigwe, disclosed this in a briefing in Abuja after the NSE listing on Thursday. According to Nwigwe, Briclinks Africa Plc traded its securities on the newly created growth board of the NSE, which already has four firms. The four firms, drafted to the new category 10 months after it was launched, are: Chellarams Plc; LivingTrust Mortgage Bank Plc; McNichols Plc; and The Initiates Plc. The NSE growth board is an upgraded version of the NSE Alternative Securities Market (ASeM) board designed for small and mid-sized fast-growth companies to raise critical long-term capital at relatively low cost to realise their business potential. As newly listed on the NSE, this will enhance Briclinks’ visibility, stimulates its liquidity, brings transparency and efficiency, as well as increases employee value and morale.
