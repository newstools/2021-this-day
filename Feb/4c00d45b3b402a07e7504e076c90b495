By Udora Orizu The House of Representatives at the plenary yesterday cautioned Nigerian governors and other public officials against making inflammatory, divisive statements or actions that can cause unrest in the country, urging them to channel their focus on possible solution to addressing insecurity in Nigeria. The House also resolved to interface with Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF), insisting that most of these statements are coming from the governors. The resolutions followed the adoption of a motion of urgent public importance, sponsored by Hon. Dachung Bagos. Moving the motion, Bagos made reference to the statement by the Governor of Bauchi State, Senator Bala Mohammed who had last week justified the illegal bearing of firearms by Fulani herdsmen, which caused national outrage. The lawmaker opined that a public official who speaks on the insecurity problems in the country needs to be careful. He said the House is aware that the constitution does not grant any individual or group of people the right to bare sophisticated arms but only a licensed specified shooting range to that effect from the Inspector-General of the Nigeria Police Force (IG); He explained that even if the IG were to grant licenses, his power cannot contravene the provisions of chapter F28 LFN 004 Fire Arms Act which classifies the arms (AK-47) carried by herdsmen as ascribed by the governor as illegal and prohibited. Bagos expressed worry that the inflammatory and divisive statement by the governor, will lead to the erroneous belief that the government supports the crimes of carrying prohibited firearms. ‘’This situation can easily lead to armed conflict as other groups such as farmers and defenceless citizens will consider it as a threat to their safety and opt to arm themselves with AK-47. If all public officials regardless their position or status are not cautioned against inciting or provoking the general public, the already tense situation in the country will lead to open hostilities,’’ he said
