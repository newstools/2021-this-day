By Omon-Julius Onabu A policeman attached to Delta State Police Command was killed by dare-devil armed robbers, who reportedly ambushed a bullion van conveying an undisclosed huge amount of money to Asaba from Agbor in Ika North-East Local Government Area of the state. The deceased policeman, identified as Mr. Sunday Ogar, who is an inspector, was in the team of a new generation bank’s special escort when the heavily armed bandits struck. The Acting Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Delta Police Command, Mr. Frank Edafe, a deputy superintendent of police (DSP), who confirmed the incident via an emailed statement issued last night, said that two other policemen escorting the bullion van also sustained gunshot wounds. Edafe said that the two policemen were rushed to the Federal Medical Centre in Asaba, along with the late Ogar, and subsequently treated there. The state police spokesman stated that two of the robbers sustained serious gunshot wounds following the ensuing fierce exchange of fire with the police escort team but managed to be taken away by their gang members. The bandits also carted away a yet-to-be ascertained amount of cash from the bullion van. According to the Delta PPRO, the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon at a point between Utulu and Ubulu-Okiti on the Benin-Asaba Expressway. Although no arrests have been reported, the police spokesman assured that a “manhunt” for the fleeing criminals had already commenced in a bid to bring the culprits to book.
