Mary Nnah Dubai Tourism in partnership with Rivers State Tourism Development Agency has announced the winners of the 2020 RSTDA/ DTCM Graffiti challenge. The unveiling ceremony took place recently during a press briefing in Rivers State, Nigeria. The event which was in a show of collaborative effort to encourage tourism and reward talents in the Arts between Dubai Tourism and Rivers State Tourism Development Agency, ensured the observation of the COVID-19 protocols and social distancing amongst the attendees. In attendance of the event, Director International Operations, Dubai Tourism, Stella Fubara Obinwa expressed her excitement towards the positives that the collaboration has made in the lives of the winners and charting a course for other possibilities in the future. As a first of its kind collaboration, she assured the winners that the process to ensure their trip to Dubai is in motion. Obinwa also announced that each of the winners will be gifted an iPhone 11 Max to help them capture memorable moments as they journey through life. The winning art works, bio and photographs of the winners were displayed on the multimedia screen for the appreciation of invited guests. The Director General/Chief Executive Officer, Rivers state Tourism Development Agency, Yibo Koko was full of commendation for Dubai Tourism for this uncommon collaboration which was an attestation of his vision for the agency in terms of Digital Tourism and intangible Creative Marketplace Commodities as opposed to the regular and monolithic approach to Tourism that starts and ends in onsite carnival displays. Speaking further on the initiative, the Commissioner of Culture and Tourism, Mrs Tonye Oniyide said the wonderful collaboration has revealed the artistic talent in some of the youths of Rivers extraction. She pledged the readiness of the ministry to create an enabling ambience for more of such mutually beneficial collaborations in the future.
