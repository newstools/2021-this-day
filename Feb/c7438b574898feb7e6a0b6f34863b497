The Minister also thanked the Lagos State Government and their officials for their effective collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing engineers in ensuring the supervision and provision of traffic control support services to the contractors. He expressed appreciation to all those who played one positive role or another, including contractor Messrs Borini Prono; FERMA, LASTMA, FRSC , media and the civil society organizations. The statement said Fashola thanked all the commuters whose patience, understanding and cooperation were the biggest tools for the successful execution of the works and wishes all motorists who use the bridge a safe motoring experience.

The partial closure of the bridge led to untold hardship for the people due to traffic gridlock in several parts of the city.
