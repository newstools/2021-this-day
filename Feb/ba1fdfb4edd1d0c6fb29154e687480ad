Facebook has removed the page of Nigerian separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu for violating its rules on harm and hate speech, according to BBC. Kanu’s IPOB page was removed for repeated violation of its community rules, the social networking site told the BBC. According to the report, the action was taken by the social media giant after Kanu posted a video of a militia group attacking and killing cattle in a herders’ settlement, and also used the live broadcast to accuse herders of destroying farmlands in eastern Nigeria.
