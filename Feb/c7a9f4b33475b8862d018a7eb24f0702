By Ugo Aliogo The month of love is upon us and TikTok is excited to announce an exclusive Valentine’s Day LIVE performance by ‘Baby’ hitmaker, Justin Bieber. Taking place at the Drew House in Los Angeles, Bieber will be treating the TikTok community to a lovely performance where he will play his entire album, ‘JOURNALS’, for the first time. Be sure to get your song list and lyrics in order, and tune in via Bieber’s TikTok account, @justinbieber, at 6p m PST/9 pm EST on Sunday, 14 February, or for the rebroadcast on Monday, 15 February 2021, from 8 pm NG time. In the meantime, TikTok is encouraging its community to hop on the app and spread the love with the launch of the #ValentinesDay2021 challenge – a perfect way to tell your bae, bestie or beautiful self “Happy Valentine’s Day”. What is great is that the challenge is made for everyone; all you have to do is showcase the love you have and your creativity the best way they know how. This could be through cute red and pink outfits or cooking delicious meals for your Valentine. Some may choose to celebrate the day with a little laughter and post their favourite singles memes while others may do some last-minute killer workouts to impress their dates. Whatever you decide, we want to see it – so bring it on. Adding to the festivities, users will also be spoiled with a dedicated Valentine’s Day playlist made up of hot theme songs such as True Love, Falling In Love and What You Know About Love, which users can add onto their creations. While we can all agree that Valentine’s Day will be somewhat different this year, local creators have still come out to show us their #ValentinesDay2021 spirit.
