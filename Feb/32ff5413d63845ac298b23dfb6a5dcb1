By Deji Elumoye The federal government on Thursday offered automatic employment to 110 ex-corps members in the Federal Civil Service and scholarships for the pursuit of post-graduate studies up to doctoral level in any university in Nigeria. Speaking at the virtual 2018/2019 President’s National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) honours award ceremony held at the State House in Abuja, President Muhammadu Buhari also announced cash rewards for the ex-corps members. He directed the relevant government agencies to ensure timely implementation of all the incentives for the award recipients. Urging the honorees to sustain the patriotic zeal that earned them the award, the president said: ‘‘It is noteworthy that the young men and women being honoured have excelled in the four cardinal programmes of the scheme, namely: Orientation Course, Primary Assignment, Community Development Service and Winding-up/Passing-out, which formed the basis of assessment for the Honours Award. ‘‘On behalf of the government and the good people of Nigeria, I heartily congratulate those honoured on standing out from their peers in order to merit the honour being bestowed upon them. ‘‘You have proved yourselves worthy ambassadors of your respective families and the National Youth Service Corps. I am very proud of you and confident that the Award shall spur you to greater service to the nation and humanity,’’ he said.
