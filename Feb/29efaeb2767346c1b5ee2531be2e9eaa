By Rebecca Ejifoma Several protesters have been arrested by the police for defying governmentâ€™s warning not to stage any protest at the Lekki Tollgate in Lagos on Saturday Some youths had taken to the social media to express outrage over the directive last week by the chairperson of the Lagos Judicial Panel, Doris Okuwobi, to return the control of Lekki Tollgate to the Lekki Concession Company and reopen toll collection. They consequently slated a protest tagged #occupyLekkitollgate protest for Saturday to express their opposition to the reopening of the toll gate. A counter-protest #DefendLagos also surfaced on the social media with some youths announcing their plan to stage a protest to defend Lagos State against the
#occupyLekkitollgate protest. Government however issued a stern warning that no fresh protest will be allowed at.the tollgate. In a bid to forestall the protest, armed policemen had taken over the Lekki Tollgate in Lagos. The armed policemen, patrol vehicles and armoured personnel carrier were deployed Friday evening to the tollgate, which was the epicenter of the #EndSARS protest last October. Several youths however defied the warning on as they gathered on Saturday to stage a peace protest at the Tollgate. Atleast 10 protesters were arrested by the police team at the tollgate and locked up in a police lorry (Black Maria).
The arrested youths took to Twitter and posted video where they decried that they were arr3sted and locked in a Black Mariah after they attempted to resume their protest. Several youths are also using social media, especially Twitter to continue their agitations.
