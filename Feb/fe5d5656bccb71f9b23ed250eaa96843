By Adibe Emenyonu Communities in Dagbala and Uneme-Erhurun in Akoko-Edo Local Government Area of Edo State are under tension following the influx of persons suspected to be foreigners to mine the gold in the area. This is as the indigenes believed the “foreign miners” are not licenced to mine, even as there is apprehension that these persons are also luring their women into marriages and amorous relationships. Besides, there are also speculations that most kidnapped victims by suspected criminal herders in Okpella, Abuja/Auchi expressway, and Atte/Sasaro, taken to the forest at Dagbala are being perpetrated by the suspected ‘foreign miners’ and that security agencies are aware of this happenings but not taking appropriate actions. A resident of the area alleged in confidence that “recently, containers of sophisticated arms and dynamites were being imported into the community at night by these miners without any community member knowing about it. “Various vehicles with government plate numbers have been bringing some people to this community almost on a daily basis from Southeast, Southwest and the northern region.” Reacting to the development yesterday, the Chairman of Akoko-Edo LGA, Mr. Don Umoru, said he held a security meeting where it was resolved that all mining activities in the community should be suspended while another meeting with the miners has been scheduled. According to Umoru, “We have just risen from a security council meeting now with the Dagbala community, traditional rulers and security chiefs. We have put a stop to all the activities going on in Dagbala, and we have issued an ultimatum that they should stop all their activities. “We are also inviting the miners and the owners of the land for a meeting where we will look at the issues. Meanwhile, we have stopped all their activities. Though their activities are between them and the state and the federal governments, the local government is their first point of contact with the authorities.”
