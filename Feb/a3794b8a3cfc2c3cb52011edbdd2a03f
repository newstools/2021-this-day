Since he was reportedly flown out of the country last December after allegedly contracting Covid-19, not much has been heard of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad and no one seems to be concerned about him. Although he was said to have been initially slated for a medical checkup abroad before the Covid-19 infection upset the plan, however, no updates have since been given on his health and whereabouts and everyone seems not to be bother?
