TRANSFER NEWS… Sergio Ramos is ready to quit Real Madrid this summer for the Premier League– as he doesn’t fancy Paris St Germain. According to UK’s Mirror, talks over a new contract at the Bernabeu have collapsed and that means Ramos – whose trophy haul includes five La Liga titles, four Champions Leagues, a World Cup and two European Championships – will be available on a free transfer in July. He is entitled to talk to clubs outside of Spain right now to secure a pre-contract agreement – and his agent, brother Rene Ramos, is targeting England. The Spanish international is unconvinced by a move to Paris and has already turned down offers from Asia because his family are not keen on the destination. There are, however, only a handful of clubs who can afford Ramos’ wages. Even at 34 he will expect to earn more than £200,000 a week – and turned down a new two-year deal at Real when he was asked to take a 10 percent pay cut. Sources close to the player believe a move to Manchester Cityor Liverpoolwould be ‘very difficult’ but no club is being ruled out. And that could alert Everton, especially as Carlo Ancelotti managed Ramos for two years in Madrid between 2013-15.
