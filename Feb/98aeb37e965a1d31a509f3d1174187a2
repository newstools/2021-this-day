It is often thought that intelligence is inherited although now there may be evidence that stupidity can also be inherited. Donald Trump Junior has attacked teachers because they don’t want to work in unsafe conditions and said that “The teachers unions are out of control & are destroying our kid’s futures!” Nobody should have to work in an unsafe environment although often service members, first responders and medical workers face danger regularly but the teaching environment is meant to be a safe and supportive one whereas Junior is not showing any support and wants them to face a danger to their health. Yes, poor education can damage a kid’s future but so can poverty, racism, poor medical facilities and poor employment prospectives. Time to turn off not just the Trump twitter feed but the whole families’ coverage. Dennis Fitzgerald,
