By Kingsley Nwezeh The Federal Capital Territory Police Command has launched an investigation into the alleged existence of a human milk factory that also harbours 115 young mothers in the nation’s capital. It denied any rescue operation or arrest in connection with 115 young mothers involved in the human milk factory. There has been an online report that breast milk of young, pregnant mothers in an undisclosed location in Abuja is used to produce cheese for online sale.
