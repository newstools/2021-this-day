While many in his class would travel around the world and spend several millions of naira celebrating their birthdays, the Chairman, Zinox Group, Leo Stan Ekeh, would instead celebrate his business achievements. Though this does not mean that he is not appreciative of God’s blessings in his life, he only detests a carnival-like celebration on such occasions. No wonder, when the billionaire businessman turned 65 on Monday, February 22, 2021, he only spent the day with his children and grandchildren.
