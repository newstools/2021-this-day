Leicester will be without James Maddison for the second leg of their Europa League clash with Slavia Prague. The England midfielder has been in London seeing a specialist about his hip injury that flared up against Aston Villa last weekend.l Leicester will also be without the suspended Super Eagles forward, Kelechi Iheanacho. “We don’t believe he needs more surgery,” manager Brendan Rodgers said of Maddison, who had an operation on his hip in July. “James won’t be available. He is in consultation with our doctor and some specialists, we are just trying to see where we’re at,” Rodgers said. “We’ll look to be pretty flexible, we have other players with other attributes. We’ve had injuries all season and the beauty of this team and squad is they are quite flexible and they are very adaptable.” James Justin (knee), Ayoze Perez (knee), Dennis Praet (hamstring) and Wesley Fofana (hamstring) also remain out.
