Former Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, is reportedly set to join Saudi Arabian side Al-Shabab after leaving Old Trafford. The Nigerian, 31, spent a year on loan at Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side from Shanghai Shenhua but his deal came to an end last week. And Sky Sportsreports the ex-Watfordforward has agreed a permanent move to Al-Shabab. Ighalo had to take a pay cut to make his dream move to United as he was reeling in an eye-watering £300,000 a week in China. At United, he collected £180,000 and he should be in for another good pay day in the Middle East as Barcelona legend Xavi received in the region of £160,000 a week at Saudi side Al-Sadd – where he is now the boss. Ighalo had been due to return to China but he has been given dispensation to speak to the Saudi side. The transfer window in Saudi Arabia is open for another week before slamming shut on February 7. The move is set to go ahead as long as personal terms are agreed and the player passes a medical. Ighalo arrived at Carrington 12 months ago in a deadline day loan deal that shocked manyand was only initially set to last six months before he impressed enough to earn an extension. Ighalo bagged five goals in 23 appearances in all competitions but fell behind Edinson Cavaniin the pecking order after the Uruguayan’s arrival in October.
