By Kingsley Nwezeh The former Chief of Army Staff, Lt General Tukur Buratai (rtd), has said that he would not reply the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over the party’s criticism of his tenure, insisting he had performed well. The PDP had faulted his nomination as ambassador, saying it was a ploy by government to shield him and other service chiefs from probe over alleged human rights abuses committed as service chiefs. Buratai, who spoke at a reception organised by the 29th Regular Course in his honour in Abuja, said he had no word for the position of the opposition. “It’s an honourable retirement and also an honourable appointment. I’m not a politician, so I have no word for the opposition. I have done well”, he said. He said his reign as army chief was eventful. “I am happy that in July last year, my officers at the Army headquarters compiled a compendium of my achievements. “In fact, I can’t even remember all the projects that we have executed. Is it in terms of infrastructure? Is it in terms of capacity building? Is it in terms of training?”, he queried. Buratai said “since I was appointed, there was never a dull moment in terms of training. “Remember the various exercises. These are training exercises from ‘Python dance’, ‘Crocodile smile’, and even the latest one ‘Exercise Sahel Sanity’. “Is it in the area of medical? In terms of education of our children and wards, the Nigerian Army University are all great achievements.” The former army chief commended members of the 29th Regular Course Association for being such wonderful friends and course mates and organising such a befitting event in his honour, adding that he felt so happy to be celebrated. “It means a lot to me and my family. It is also a mark of fulfilment and pride that you have been recognised for the service you have rendered to your nation and your people,” he said.
