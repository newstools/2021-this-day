American fashion designer, businesswoman, and writer, Rachel Zoe, noted that “style is a way to say who you are without having to speak.” After watching him spend more than six months as the monarch of Iruland and in his characteristic modest cast, the family and friends of Oba Gbolahan Lawal finally convinced him to wear his status as he should. The 15th Oniru of Iruland, Oba Omogbolahan Lawal, Abisogun the Second, has got himself a Rolls Royce Cullinan. This is coming after months of his friends and well-wishers insisting that the Oniru embrace his royal status, and wear that status with the natural furnishings expected of him. A somewhat interesting adjuration, it is not without merit, especially because Oba Lawal is modest and inclined to simplicity rather than a needless extravagance. The Rolls Royce Cullinan reportedly landed in Oniru’s garage a few days ago, cementing his person and style in the stratum of kings and influential nobles of this world. Naturally, considering Oba Lawal’s rousing touch to the winds of development ongoing at Iruland, Victoria Island, Lagos, the Cullinan just barely caps his royalty. To the aware, the Rolls Royce Cullinan is no middling vehicle. The model is the first SUV (sport utility vehicle) built for all sorts of terrain and weather, with comfort and luxury in equal measure. This indicates that the Oniru is not about spreading his colourful feathers before all and sundry, but a King prepared to travel the length of his kingdom for maximum interaction. All in all, a practical vehicle for a practical monarch. Since his official coronation in June of 2020, Oba Lawal has spent his waking hours pursuing his people’s welfare and the progress of his Iru Kingdom. The hearts of the Iru people are fully with the Oniru, and why not? Oba Omogbolahan Lawal is a godsend! Indeed, a king is the symbol of power and progress—and Oba Gbolahan Lawal is not letting down his people.
