Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade This year, Valentine’s Day falls on a Sunday. Hopefully, this gives you ample time to prepare for it. It is all about romance and expressing your love to the one you cherish the most. It comes with high expectations and preparing for it can create a lot of anxiety and stress. To make your Valentine’s Day easy, here are ten tips that will ensure you create a day that is charming and memorable. 1. Set reminders and create calendar events To start preparing for Valentine’s Day, remind yourself that the little things matter when expressing your love. Using your Google Assistant, set reminders and create calendar events to ensure that little details do not fall through the cracks. Schedule time to clean the house, get a babysitter (if you have a baby), buy ingredients for V-day’s food recipes and make reservations. You can simply create new calendar events by telling Assistant, “add to my calendar” or “make an appointment” followed by the event’s name, and optionally even location. For instance, you could say: “Add to my calendar, buy red roses on February 12th at 10a.m,” Google Assistant is available on most current Android devices. You can access it by setting up “Hey, Google” voice activation. 2. Create a playlist of romantic songs <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-490755" src="https://i2.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/d743e52e-namaste-wahala.jpg?resize=595%2C335&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="595" height="335" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Love songs are perfect for stirring up a romantic mood.

Find inspiration for the lounge You can choose to break away from the norm of spending time in a fancy restaurant and hotel. Bring the love back home and spend quality time with your sweetheart.

See listings of the names and addresses of the restaurants, opening hours, directions, a price scale and even user reviews so you can see if it’s worth making a reservation. It is important to make sure that the menu can accommodate your dietary preferences and to check if it is within your budget. It is imperative that you adhere to Covid-19 preventive measures if you must spend Valentine’s Day outdoors at a restaurant, so be sure to ensure that the restaurant is operating with Covid-19 guidelines for businesses in Nigeria. 6. Connect with your sweetheart over a distance If you are in a long distance relationship or you have been separated due to the Covid-19 travel ban, never mind, lover’s day can still be memorable. Make use of Google Meet to connect with your sweetheart. Set up a video call to share the day together. You can have a romantic meal via the call, stream a movie together, listen to your favourite playlist online or just sincerely confess your love to each other among other planned activities. 7. Relieve your love by creating and sharing photo memories With Google photos, you can relieve your love memories and share with your sweetheart on Valentine’s Day.
