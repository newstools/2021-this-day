The Director General, Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Mallam Farouk Salim, has restated the determination of the agency to serve as role model in safeguarding Nigerians from the menace of imported and locally made substandard products. He said this would be achieved by ramping up enforcement of standards nationwide and making country hostile for producers and distributors of substandard products. Speaking at a 4-day leadership strategy retreat for members of staff in Calabar, Cross Rivers State, Salim said he was committed to building on the solid foundation laid by previous management of the agency. In a statement issued by Head, Public Relations, SON, Mr. Bola Fashina, the DG pointed out that retreat was aimed at repositioning SON for greater effectiveness and efficiency in delivery of its mandate of setting and enforcing standards for goods, processes and systems in the country. According to him, the SON strategy retreat is the first major outing in a series of agenda-setting programmes which are part of measures to set the organisationâ€™s targets for 2021 and beyond as well as putting it on the path of becoming the foremost standards institution in Africa. The statement added that the retreat would deal with the art and science of execution for regulatory agencies, key performance indicators and stakeholder management, among other issues.
The former Director General/Chef Executive, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Dakuku Peterside, will deliver the keynote speech at the occasion among other facilitator.
