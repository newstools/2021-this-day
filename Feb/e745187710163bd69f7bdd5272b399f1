Many people were seen fleeing into other parts of the town fearing that it may be a prelude to further attacks. One of those that spoke, said: “this is strange, in all the years of the attack on Maiduguri, we have not seen such massive rocket landing on us. “We just need to flee into town for it is getting dark and we do not know what lies ahead.” As at the time of filing the report, the source of the rocket was unknown. All attempts to get the military and other security agencies to talk on the incident were unsuccessfully as messages sent to their known spokesmen were not replied and calls to their mobile lines were not picked.
