Emma Okonji The Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, has emphasised the important role played by women in the country’s socio-economic and political space.
He also underscored the need to empower women with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as an enabler for social change. Danbatta stated this while delivering a goodwill message at a recent webinar organised by Zinari Communications Limited with the theme: “Mainstreaming Rural Women Enterprise Development into Digital Economy Initiative: The Opportunities, Strategies and Constraints.” According to Danbatta, who was represented by the Head, Online Media and Special Publication at NCC, Grace Ojougboh, “there is no doubt that women have been historically central to socio-economic and political development of any nation.”
He therefore stressed the need for nations to focus more on how ICT could be leveraged for increased empowerment for women. He said: “There has been a general concern that unless the gender divide between men and women is specifically addressed, there is a risk that ICT may worsen existing inequalities between women and men which could create new forms of inequality.
“However, if the gender dimensions of ICT in terms of access and use, capacity-building opportunities, employment and potential for empowerment are explicitly identified and addressed, ICT can be a powerful catalyst for political, economic and social empowerment of women, and the promotion of gender equality.” He advocated for increased collaboration between public and private-sector stakeholders toward advancing gender equality and women empowerment, notably by encouraging young women and girls to pursue studies and careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Danbatta, promised that the Commission would continue to play a front-seat role in driving the implementation of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) document, 2020-2030; the Nigeria National Broadband Plan (NNBP), 2020-2025 and similar policies aimed at increased connectivity to all the citizens to bridge gender digital disparity. Danbatta said the Commission would constantly provide the necessary infrastructure that would guarantee ubiquitous access to telecoms services through the implementation of these policies while listing other initiatives undertaken by the Universal Service Provision Fund (USPF), all aimed at boosting connectivity and provision of ICT tools among citizens of Nigeria, regardless of gender. He listed the initiatives to include the Community Resource Centres (CRC), School Knowledge Centres (SKC), E-accessibility projects, among others.
“There is no doubt that these efforts will facilitate development of a vibrant digital ecosystem where rural women can play very important roles in our socio-economic and political space,” he added.
