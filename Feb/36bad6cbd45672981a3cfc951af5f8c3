Ecobank Nigeria has said its customers can now transfer funds by email, SMS and Whatsapp – which are new features available on the bank’s Mobile App. The bank disclosed this in a statement. Speaking, Head, Consumer Banking Ecobank Nigeria, Olukorede Demola-Adenyi, said the initiative was part of the bank’s innovation in digital banking, enabling customers perform their transactions conveniently. She also spoke on the simplified and more appealing interface of the Mobile App, making it easier and convenient for people to transfer funds from their accounts with the App. “This opportunity couldn’t have come at a better time when many people are self-isolating and keeping social distance due to the COVID-19. We have the responsibility as a bank to continue to innovate for the benefits of our teeming customers. “We encourage our customers and others to utilize this new addition to our digital self-service solutions. With this feature, a customer can transfer up to N50,000 without the beneficiary’s account number. The transfer can be initiated without the beneficiary providing an account number or deciding on which account to receive the funds into. For us as a bank, this is super convenient for money transfer.” Demola- Adeniyi further said, the process was simple, adding that beneficiaries could redeem the money sent in three simple steps: Receive the web link sent to his mobile number as SMS or WhatsApp message, click on the link to select bank and enter the account number, then, submit the request and senders account is immediately debited. The beneficiary account irrespective of the bank receives the credit instantly. The process is secure, convenient and funds are in local currency and do not leave the senders account until the beneficiary initiates the redemption into the destination account. She called on those who are yet to download the Ecobank Mobile app to do so without delay because of the attendant benefits.
