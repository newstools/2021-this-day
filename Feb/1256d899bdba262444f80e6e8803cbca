No fewer than 110 former members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) who distinguished themselves during their service years will receive national honours. The NYSC said the award would be conferred on them by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Old Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The Director-General of the NYSC, Brig. Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, at a press briefing yesterday, said 500 corps members from the state level were nominated for the award by the National Selection Committee, with 110 making the final list. “The processes are rigorous because we want to ensure that only those that duly qualify win the award, and for a corps member to win this award, he/she must have won the award from local government to the state and then forwarded to the national level,” Ibrahim explained. He appealed to corps members not to relent in their drive towards peace, growth and development of the country.
