The Women in Energy Network (WIEN) in collaboration with the Renewable Energy Association of Nigeria (REAN) have concluded plan to host the International Women in Energy symposium with the theme: ‘Light Up Africa.’ The programme, a virtual symposium, is scheduled to hold on March 13, 2020, as part of activities to mark this year’s International Women’s Day (IWD). Speaking to journalist via a virtual platform recently, the Publicity Director, WIEN, Charlotte Essiet and the Head of Communications, REAN, Chioma Ome, said the programme would bring together women in energy across Africa. This, they said would yield initiatives that would extend their footprint to new frontiers and increase women’s talent contribution to light up Africa. The President of WIEN, Ms. Funmi Ogbue, said celebrating IWD, in partnership with REAN, would bring together the women in energy across Africa to collaborate on a S.M.A.R.T gender inclusion action plan, signing a charter to commit to the action items within a certain timeline. “We are kicking-off a week long activities, starting up with the Light Up Africa with women pledge. “Leveraging on the 2021 global IWD theme, the organisers will encourage CEOs of key companies and government officials in Nigeria to do a photo supporting IWD theme and post on their social media handles using #Lightupafrica#chosetochallenge#. “Stakeholders will be asked to choose from a couple of key themes presented by the organisers to make public commitments to drive positive change and monitor progress towards gender equality in the energy industry and a gender equal Africa.” Another initiative WIEN will be embarking on, Ogbue noted, would be the ‘Supernova girl’ initiative to encourage and motivate young girls to study related subjects and aspire to come into the energy industry, adding that it plans to embark on school visits to enlighten them on the importance of STEM and why the girl child should join the energy space and light up Africa.
