A gang of six bandits headed by one Auwalu Daudawa have surrendered 28 AK-47 with 27 magazines and General Machine Gun in Zamfara State. The repentant bandits who swore by the Qur’an during a ceremony at the Government House on Monday declared that they would not go back to banditry. Daudawa also promised to convince those who were yet to repent to do so. Receiving the repentant bandits, Governor Bello Matawalle called on all the bandits to come out and accept the peace process initiated by his administration. He said, “My administration would take proper care of all the bandits that have repented, and I will continue to dialogue with bandits to end banditry in the state.”
