Everyone has probably seen the Bernie Sanderâ€™s photo of him rugged up with the mittens and then the numerous memes of it and although it was mostly a funny picture and a few laughs a handmade crotched doll of it has now raised over US$40,000 for meals on wheels. This is a charity that the Senator supports. It is an interesting story that combines amusement, generosity and the reality that there are a lot of people who are cold and hungry and that any help will be appreciated. Probably the greatest benefit is the publicity meals on wheels will get and it should encourage all of that can that we should help those less well off, especially in the COVID times.
