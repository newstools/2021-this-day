The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has raised the alarm over its cloned Facebook account, advising members of the public not to be deceived by the fake account. In a statement signed by its Director of Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, NCC said in the course of its regular
online surveillance aimed at protecting telecoms consumers and industry stakeholders, it discovered a spurious Facebook account purporting to be that of the Commission. According to the statement: “We have since contacted Facebook team to take down the fake account.
“The fraudulent Facebook account with the name: Nigerian Communications Commission – NCC – Info Zone was opened by unidentified individuals, ostensibly to deceive and defraud unsuspecting members of the public, some of whom, as NCC believes, may have inadvertently signed on to the fake Facebook account. “It is important to emphasise that the official and authentic Facebook account of the Commission is: NIGERIAN COMMUNICATIONS Commission with over 192,193 followers and the Commission strongly advises the general public and telecom consumers to beware of this cloned Facebook account, as the NCC has no affiliation whatsoever with it.” The statement further said: “This is a typical case of profile cloning often used to create a fake profile identical to an original one, for the purpose of misleading and defrauding unsuspecting general public. “Members of the public are advised to disregard the Facebook page and its content in their entirety.
The NCC, as a responsible organisation, will continue to take measures towards protecting telecoms consumers and industry stakeholders.”
