By Deji Elumoye President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with the Chairman/Chief Executive Officer, Nigeria Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Mrs. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, over the demise of her mother, Alhaja Sadiat Abeke Erogbogbo, a retired teacher and business woman, who was aged 90. The President in a condolence message, according to his Media Adviser, Mr. Femi Adesina, equally sent words of comfort to the other children, grandchildren and great grandchildren of the departed, who was known as ‘Kind Teacher’ in the early part of her professional life. Buhari recalled that Alhaja Erogbogbo was a well-rounded Nigerian, born in Kano, schooled in Lagos, and later taught in Kano, Lagos and Jos, where she impacted positively on the lives of students who passed through her tutelage, hence the sobriquet, ‘Kind Teacher.’ The President also prayed for the repose of the soul of Mama Erogbogbo and that God will comfort all those she left behind.
