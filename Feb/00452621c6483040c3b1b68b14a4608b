The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command has arrested the head of a community in Abuja and three others for their alleged involvement in kidnapping. The suspects, who were undergoing interrogation, were believed to have aided kidnap gangs in their community located between Zuba and Giri Junction, on the Zuba-Gwagwalada Expressway in the Gwagwalada area of the FCT. It was gathered that a retired Assistant Comptroller-General of the Nigerian Immigration Service, Abdulahi Rakieu, and three others abducted in the Tungan Maje area of Gwagwalada on Saturday, had been released. The victims were said to have breathed the air of freedom on Tuesday. The ex-NIS officer and the other victims were taken away by the kidnappers, who reportedly gained access to their residence by breaking the wall and destroying the anti-burglar irons. A police spokesperson, ASP Mariam Yusuf, confirmed the arrest of the kidnap suspects and the release of Rakieu and the other hostages. “Yes, we have arrested some suspects in connection with the kidnapping at Tungan Maje. Four persons, including the head of a community, are in custody undergoing interrogation over the kidnapping incidents along that axis,” she confirmed yesterday.
