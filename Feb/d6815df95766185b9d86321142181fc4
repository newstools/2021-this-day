The court also directed the respondent (HEOSL) to immediately appoint two members of its company for the purpose of constituting the Performance Assessment Team in line with Clause 1 and 10.2 of the OML 30 Facilities Protection Services Agreement entered into between the parties. But, the applicant in a letter dated February 2, 2021 written to the Group Legal Counsel, First City Monument Bank, entitled ‘’Disobedience of court order in suit No: FHC/L/CS/1467/2020’’ accused the bank of conspiring with Heritage Oil (respondent) to dissipate the funds from account numbers 4135082040 USD and 4135082033 NGN respectively.
The letter stated that since the interim order is to last till the hearing and determination of the motion on notice, all parties must maintain status quo until the motion on notice is determined.
