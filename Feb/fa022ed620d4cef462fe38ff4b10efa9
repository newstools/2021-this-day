The Chief Executive Officer of Century Power Generation Limited, Dr. Chukwueloka Umeh, has said that for Nigeria to meet its National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP) target, which is to meter 30 million consumers over two years, local manufacturers must be empowered. In a statement, Umeh advised that instead of procuring the meters, government should let private companies drive the process for efficiency and retain capital in the country. He called for the creation of an enabling environment where Nigerian manufacturers can grow, “and if people want to import meters, the market is big enough.” Umeh, who is also the Chief Operating Officer of the Nestoil Group, while commenting on the tariff increment hinted that although power consumers complained about paying more for darkness, saying Nigerians have to be patient as it would unfortunately take time for them to see the value of the tariff increment. According to him, “All issues across the whole value chain of the power sector must be resolved simultaneously and on a large scale, not one after the other, if Nigerians are to get regular electricity supply in the foreseeable future. “Government to find a way to grow the income of the populace by creating a conducive investment climate so that small, medium and large businesses businesses can grow, thereby putting more money in Nigerians’ pockets. “President Muhammadu Buhari had committed that Nigerians would be metered before the end of his administration and that estimated billing would be ended. “The free distribution of meters was part of the agreement reached between the federal government and the organised labour after the government increased the electricity tariff in 2020. Nigerians need to see these promises fulfilled.”
