The Nigerian stock market shed N368 billion last week following profit-taking activities by some investors after the massive gains in January. The market had appreciated by N1.1 trillion in January due to sustained high demand for stocks.
However, the bears set in the first week of February as some investors moved in to lock in part of the gains. Bearish sentiments dominated the local bourse in all the five trading sessions. Consequently, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) All-Share Index (ASI) fell by 1.66 per cent to close lower at 41.709.09, while market capitalisation shed N368 billion to be at N21.819 trillion. Apart from profit-taking, analysts stated that some investors sold down in anticipation of uptick in yields in fixed income market as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) hiked rates in the Open Market Operations (OMO). Commenting on the performance, analysts at Cordros Securities Research stated that with the moderation in the prices of bellwether stocks last week, they expect savvy investors to take advantage of this and make re-entry ahead of their full year 2020 earnings announcement. “However, we note that the recent hike in OMO rates by the CBN will continue to stoke uncertainties on the direction of yields, keeping risk-averse investors on the side-lines. “Thus, we expect a zig-zag market performance in the week ahead. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” they said.
