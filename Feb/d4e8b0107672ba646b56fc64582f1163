Midea, one of the world’s leading home appliance producers, has announced its global partnership expansion with City Football Group. According to a statement, Midea’s relationship with City Football Group started in January 2020, when it became an Official Partner of Manchester City, adding that after a highly successful first year of partnership, the decision was made to expand the relationship by adding the Manchester City Women’s team and New York City FC. The highlight of the 2020 partnership was the #MideaHomeChallenge – a six-week campaign where players, coaches, legends and fans took part in a series of challenges and trick-shots using their household appliances. It stated that the social media campaign, which generated millions of engagements, was a creative solution to engage and inspire football fans all around the world who were stuck at home during lockdown. SVP of Global Partnerships at City Football Group, Stephan Cieplik, said: “Our partnership with Midea has been extremely successful since we launched in January 2020. “The Midea Home Challenge has been one of our most popular content campaigns which not only created high levels of digital engagement but provided fans around the world with fun challenges to help keep them entertained whilst at home. “Midea is a brand whose values and ambitions align with Manchester City and we are delighted that we are now expanding this partnership to include further teams within the City Football Group family.” Head of Brands & Communications at Midea Group’s International Business Division, Brando Brandstaeter, said: “We were thrilled to announce our partnership with Manchester City at the start of 2020. In light of the pandemic, we mobilised our teams to create the #MideaHomeChallenge, which helped kick-off the partnership in an unexpected but even more engaging way.”
