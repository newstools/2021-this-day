By Ugo Aliogo In May 2020 at the height of the lockdown occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated toll it took on the economy and the attendant effects on the vulnerable in the society, the Phurah Bookcafe hosted a foodbank in conjunction with the King’s Children Foundation and the Joshua Okeowo Foundation. The Foodbank, a project of the King’s Children Foundation is one of the many programmes of the foundation, which aims at improving the literacy level and standard of education in Lagos State among primary school children and also increasing the enrolment, participation and retention level of nursery and primary school children. The foundation also organises reading programme, mobile library services, an annual essay and arts competitions for school children and supplementary training courses for public school teachers. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-492113" src="https://i1.wp.com/storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/4370cd3d-1613488702244_phurah-bookcafe-kings-childrens-foundation-foodbank.jpg?resize=696%2C464&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="696" height="464" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Phurah Bookcafe decided to host the foodbank in conjunction with the foundations as part of its own contribution to ameliorate the burdens of the vulnerable citizens in its area of operation.
