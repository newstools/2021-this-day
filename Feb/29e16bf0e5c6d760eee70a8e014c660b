By Francis Sardauna The Katsina State Governor, Alhaji Aminu Bello Masari, yesterday warned members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) against plot to destabilise the party in the state, adding that he will not tolerate any factionalisation of the party. Masari, who stated that all those working to destabilise the party would be shown the way out in line with the party’s constitution, spoke at the APC stakeholders’ meeting on the registration and revalidation exercise of the party in Katsina. THISDAY gathered that the warning from the governor was not unconnected with the recent developments in the state, where some APC stalwarts are holding closed-door meetings ahead of the 2023 general election. The governor, who was visibly disturbed about the activities of the APC members in the state, said he would not allow any faction of the party to emerge in President Muhammadu Buhari’s home state. He explained that the party in the state under his leadership would not hesitate to sanction any member found violating its constitution irrespective of his or her political position in the state and at the national level. According to him, “I will not allow faction to emerge in Katsina State APC, especially now that the party is undergoing revalidation of its members. I urged all party members to take the ongoing revalidation and registration seriously. “If APC ward chairman can expel a national chairman of the party and his decision would be obeyed, we should follow the party’s constitution and live in peace. Anybody who violates the constitution will be punished.” Earlier, the state Registration and Revalidation Committee Chairman, Hon. Ali Kumo, had said the committee would conduct a free and fair exercise in the state.
