No fewer than seven transport union workers have been kidnapped at Iwaraja junction along Ilesha/Akure expressway in Atakunmosa West Local Government Area, Osun. The seven transport workers were said to be travelling from Osun to Akure, the Ondo State capital but were all kidnapped by suspected herdsmen. However, the kidnappers later freed three of the abductees to go find ransom to free the remaining four victims. They freed two female and one male. Security operatives, including Odua People Congress (OPC), Amotekun corps and other security agencies, are combing the forest around the Iwaraja junction where the abduction took place to rescue the four remaining victims. Osun Coordinator of OPC, Prince Deji Aladeshawe, confirmed the kidnap to journalists He said: “The kidnappers released three of the victim to go look for money while they held the remaining four. The freed victims said those that kidnapped them informed them that they are not armed robbers but herdsmen looking for money. “The kidnapper told them that they are looking for money, so they should go and bring money so that they can free the remaining victims.” Aladeshawe assured that his men and other security agencies were on ground to ensure that they rescue the four other victims. Corps Commander of Osun Amotekun, General Bashir Adewinmbi (rtd), also confirmed the kidnap of the transport workers. He said efforts were ongoing to ensure that they are released.
