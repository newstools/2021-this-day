By Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo Abia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, has charged heads of various security agencies in the state to fish out killer herdsmen in the state. The governor in a statement issued on his behalf by the Commissioner for Information, Mr. John Okiyi-Kalu said that the state government condemned in its entirety the recent destruction of farmlands by cows grazing openly in violation of extant laws of the state and Nigeria. It also condemns, without reservations, the activities of criminal herdsmen suspected to have masterminded recent brazen kidnap of innocent citizens around Abia North senatorial zone of the state. According to Okiyi-Kalu, Ikpeazu has directed security agents in the state to bring to justice all those involved in the criminal activities. He said further that the government also frowned seriously at the wanton destruction of cows by yet to be identified individuals whose aim the Abia State Governor in the statement said was to exacerbate already existing tensions. “Government has fully activated all relevant components of the state security architecture to ensure the safety of lives and property of law abiding citizens, residents and visitors to the state. “We therefore call on the people to go about their legitimate businesses without fear as the government is on top of the situation and will spare nothing in protecting Abians,” the statement added.
