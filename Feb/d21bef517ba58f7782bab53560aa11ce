By Francis Sardauna The Katsina State Deputy Governor, Alhaji Mannir Yakubu, on Wednesday revalidated his All Progressives Congress (APC) membership status at his Danmarma polling unit in Katsina, the Katsina State capital. Addressing journalists shortly after the exercise, Yakubu called on the leadership of the party to encourage more participation and ownership of the party in the state, particularly at the grassroots level. He explained that the party should adopt bottom-up process of registration and revalidation members at ward, local government and state levels, urging all members to fully participate in the ongoing exercise. The deputy governor maintained that continuous sense of ownership by members will strengthen the party’s structure and guarantee better prospects ahead of the forthcoming general election. He said: “All members of APC in the state, including those interested in the party should turn out in large numbers to revalidate and register in order to move our great party forward.” On his part, the state Registration and Revalidation Committee Chairman, Hon. Ali Kumo, said the committee would continue to discharge its obligation in line with the party’s constitution. He said the committee has adequate APC membership registration and revalidation cards that will cater for the teeming population of the state.
