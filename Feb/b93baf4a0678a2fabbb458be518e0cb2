Ugo Aliogo National President, the Apostolic Church of Nigeria, Pastor Sampson Igwe has stated that Nigeria needs God-fearing leaders to surmount its present challenges. Sampson explained that God-fearing leaders would help manage the country’s rich natural resources effectively and position the economy on the path of prosperity. The president made this known while announcing its 7th Quadrennial National Convention themed: “I will heal your land” in Lagos. Igwe, therefore, appealed to leaders to learn through the ropes of being God-fearing in order to achieve unprecedented development that would translate to meaningful standard of living for the people in the country. “All we need to surmount the challenges confronting this country are God-fearing leaders. Nigeria is in a serious issue considering the issues of banditry, kidnapping, robbery and all other forms of social vices in the country. “This country has been so richly endowed by God and for there to be meaningful development that will translate to a quality standard of living for the people of the country, we need God-fearing leaders. “I, therefore, appeal to the leaders to attend to the seeming insecurity threatening our existence as a nation.” Igwe said.
