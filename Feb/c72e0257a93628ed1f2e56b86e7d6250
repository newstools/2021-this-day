When he announced his intention to venture into the world of filmmaking some few months ago, friends and fans of high-flying banker Agbata Steve Ndubuisi, popularly known as Elder Steve Agbata, feared he was about to jettison philanthropy (for which he is known for through his Elder Steve Agbata Foundation) for the glamour of film. He, however, dispelled such speculations, saying: “I see a lot of opportunities in Nollywood, a whole lot of untapped potentials, and as someone with the mind of an entrepreneur, I see where I can come in and make a lasting impact.” He reiterated his decision to establish a film academy to be named Elder Steve Film academy. “I have a workable idea of how I can exploit the untapped raw talents that abound in the country’s movie industry,” he avowed.
Agbata, a thoroughbred banker with expertise in risk management and at least 17 years of work experience, avowed that he will continue to strike a balance between his banking occupation, his philanthropy and his soon-to-be preoccupation, filmmaking.
“Once you have passion for any interest, you will be pushed to give your best and excel,” he said. “For every endeavour that I am involved in, I am driven by passion.¨ Continuing, he said: “Despite my busy schedule as a bank manager, I still create time to do my charity works; so, expect me to devote similar energy, enthusiasm and resources to this film project.” Elder Steve Agbata, a Political Science graduate of Nnamdi Azikiwe University who also has Masters in Public Administration, has long been associated with Nollywood figures and has been a constant fixture on the red carpet where he stands out for his sartorial elegance. He concluded thus: “Given my background as a risk officer, it should be clear that I am not going into the world of film for the glamour of it, but for business.”
