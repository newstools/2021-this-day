Fulham’s Nigerian striker Josh Maja scored his first two goals for the club to secure a 2-0 win at Everton on Sunday as the visitors ended a 12-game Premier League run without a win and rekindled their hopes of avoiding relegation. The result left Fulham 18th on 18 points from 23 games, seven behind 17th-placed Newcastle United, while Everton stayed seventh on 37 from 22 after another lacklustre home performance. Everton’s poor league form continued as they suffered a third home defeat in four games, while Fulham won at Goodison Park for the first time after 22 successive defeats with Maja netting a brace in his first start for the Cottagers. The visitors missed a hatful of first-half chances before former Sunderland striker Maja, who is on loan from French side Girondins Bordeaux, slid in to steer home Ola Aina’s fizzing low cross in the 48th minute. He made it 2-0 in the 65th with another predator’s finish, popping up in front of goalkeeper Robin Olsen to tap in a rebound from close range after Harrison Reed hit the post with a long-range effort. Everton striker Josh King had a goal disallowed for offside in the closing stages which summed up the Toffees’ miserable evening as they failed to create anything meaningful up front.
