By Deji Elumoye The Senate has disclosed that it will screen the chairmanship nominee for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr Abdulrasheed Bawa, during plenary. President Muhamnadu Buhari had in a letter forwarded to the Senate, requested it to confirm the appointment of Bawa as the new chairman of the anti-graft agency. In the letter read at Tuesday plenary by the President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, President Buhari requested the upper legislative chamber’s expeditious consideration of the request. According to President Buhari, the request to screen and confirm Bawa’s appointment as the substantive chairman of the Commission was “in accordance with paragraph 2 subsection 2 of Part 1 CAP E1 of the EFCC Act 2004”. Accordingly, the President of the Senate after reading the request to senators, told them that screening of the nominee, will be done in plenary for the thoroughness it requires. “Distinguished colleagues, screening of the newly appointed EFCC Chairman, will be done in plenary in line with our tradition and in particular, for thoroughness it requires,” he said. Lawan, however, didn’t specify when the screening will be done since the communication will have to pass through legislative process of being listed on Senate’s order paper, upon which the Senate Leader will move the motion for the date the exercise will be carried out. The vacuum of the substantive chairman was created in the anti-graft agency with the suspension of Ibrahim Magu on July 6, 2020. EFCC had been under the headship of Mr Ahmed Umar in acting capacity since the suspension of Magu.
