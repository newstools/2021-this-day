Reports of unceasing invasion by herders into private properties have continued across the different parts of the country, even though the fears from this have been exacerbated by the nefarious activities of the criminal ones amongst them. But, there’s yet another disturbing slant to this concern. It is the resolve by people of other ethnic nationalities to not only seek self-help and take laws into their hands, but also their resort to jungle justice by going all out to kill suspected criminal herdsmen and their cows. This might not augur well at the end of the day. Unfortunately, this has been made possible by the lack or absence of leadership by the government, this time at all levels. While the states were hoping that the central government would lead decisively to stem the tide, the people had also trusted the states to define their powers within the federation and deliver leadership. Unfortunately, the situation is niggling! With the likelihood of a reprisal in other parts of the country, that the nation might be inching towards a fratricidal war is palpable, sadly, under the watch of a supposed general. Thus, between the criminal herders and the administrators of jungle justice, it’s a matter of six and half a dozen. Only a firm leadership can stem the unfurling ugly tide.
