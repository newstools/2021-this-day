Former Super Eagles forward and highest goal scorer at the last AFCON 2019 in Egypt, Odion Ighalo, has set his sights on winning the Saudi Professional League title with Al-Shabab. The experienced striker recently made his debut for the White Lion in their 4-1 win over Al Raed in a league match on Saturday. It was two days after the former Manchester United striker completed his move to the Saudi Arabian side from Chinese club Shanghai Greenland Shenhua. Al Shabab are currently placed at the top of the Saudi Professional League standings and Ighalo is keen to score goals which will help the team win its maiden league trophy since 2012. “I am happy to be at Al-Shabab. Before my arrival, the team was having good results, and I participated in a few minutes, but I look forward to participating more.” Ighalo said on All Nigeria Soccer. “I promise the Al-Shabab fans to score many goals, and also to win matches and make the difference. I hope the team wins all the matches, which is the important thing. “I hope that Al-Shabab will continue with the same good performance to win the league championship by the end of the season,” he added. “My aim is to score goals, and I hope to score, but the most important thing is the victory of the team, which is what we aspire to.” Ighalo, who retired from international football after the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) finals, helped Shenhua clinch the 2019 Chinese FA Cup. He scored 16 goals from 35 international matches.
