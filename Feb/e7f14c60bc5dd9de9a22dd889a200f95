The Nigeria Police Force has said that the tenure extension of the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, was not paid for. IG’s tenure was recently extended by three months by President Muhammadu Buhari. The Minister of Police Affairs, Mohammad Dingyadi who made the announcement said the extension was necessary to give room for the proper selection of a successor. However, the police, in a statement issued yesterday, described as untrue a report (not by THISDAY) that the tenure extension was purchased by the IG for N2billion. “The Police High Command has described as untrue, unfounded, defamatory and libellous, the publication dated February 07, 2021, which alleged that the IG paid over N2 billion for the tenure extension,” the statement said. “The Force wishes to state categorically that the extension of service of the IG was strictly the prerogative of the President and was never paid for as maliciously reported in the publication. “The insinuations that the IG did not “celebrate” his extension smacks of ignorance and a pathetic misplacement of priority. “The extension does not call for merry-making or celebration but a time for more work, rededication to duty and selfless service to the nation. “The IG, while assuring the nation of an unwavering commitment by the Force under his leadership, to improved service delivery, safety and security of the citizenry, enjoins members of the public to disregard and discountenance the publication as evidently untrue and unfounded. The IG is undistracted and the Force remains motivated and committed to delivering on its mandate, especially the task of neutralising current and emerging internal security threats. The statement added that the IG has directed his legal team to commence legal actions against the online news platform.
