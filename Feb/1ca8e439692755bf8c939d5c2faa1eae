By Francis Sardauna Bandits yesterday invaded Matazu Local Government Area in Katsina State and kidnapped Hajiya Rabi Muntari, the mother-in-law of renowned multi-billionaire businessman, Alhaji Dahiru Barau Mangal. The incident, according to a family member, Zaiyanu Muntari, who spoke with THISDAY, occurred at the early hours of yesterday when the fierce-looking hoodlums stormed the residence of the septuagenarian at Sha’iskawa in Matazu metropolis. THISDAY reliably gathered that the gunmen had before then abducted the father-in-law of her son, one Buhari Muntari in Katsina town. He said the brigands upon arriving the residence, started shooting sporadically in the air to scare away people in the community before whisking away the 70-year-old mother in-law of the Katsina-based business tycoon. According to him, “the bandits came to Matazu town, at ungwar Sha’iskawa to be precise around 1am today (Tuesday) and moved straight to the residence of our mother, Hajiya Rabi Muntari. They forcefully broke into her room and abducted her to unknown destination. “Hajiya Rabi is the mother-in-law of Alhaji Dahiru Barau Mangal, who is a renowned Katsina business Mogul”. He tasked the state security agents to secure her release so that she could be reunited with her aged husband, whom he said is passing through some pains at the moment. He equally called for a special surveillance in the area as the people now live in constant fear and trepidation due to the perennial blackout they have been experiencing for the past one month. When contacted, the spokesman of the State Police Command, SP Gambo Isah, claimed ignorance of the incident but promised to find out from the Division Police Officer in charge of Matazu Local Government Area and brief THISDAY. However, he had not responded as at press time.
