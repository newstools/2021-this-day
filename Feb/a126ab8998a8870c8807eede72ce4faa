Ibukun is as beautiful as they come. She is as proud as a peacock, that ultra-beautiful creature but in a very positive manner. She has hot smoldering looks and a gait that is reserved for only heavenly princess. Married to my brother Waidi Akanni , former Super Eagles star, she has built an international PR structure that is an envy internationally. She has gone from hosting pre- and post-Grammy parties where she counts some of the biggest Hollywood heavyweights in attendance to building enduring business relationships with big stars like Spike Lee, Tyler Perry and Tyrese to mention a few. She recently celebrated her 52nd birthday in a small but her usual elegant manner, hence all these effusive praises. She deserves it but then again, make I hail am, you never can tell. The woman can carry me go chop Afang with Spike Lee, who knows?
