By Omolabake Fasugbon The Abuja military plane crash, which on Sunday killed seven officials may not have escaped the spirit sight of a popular Abuja-based Prophet, Dr. Emmanuel Omale. In a video, which has gone viral on the internet, Omale, who is the Founder and Lead pastor of Divine Hand of God Prophetic Ministries International, had revealed that the incident could happen and called on Nigerians to pray. The Nigerian Air Force plane, on Sunday, had engine failure leading to the death of seven people after it crashed short of a runway outside Abuja airport. While it is often said that genuine Prophets are the mouthpiece of God, as God reveals to them the secrets things of life, Omale had in the video hinted at the incident while urging precautions. The prophecy was one of 32 given on the 1st of January 2021. While Omale gave the 32 prophecies for the year, which was published on various social media platforms, the 14th of the prophecies was specifically on the crash and may have come to pass faster than expected. The man of God had admonished for prayer but sadly negative impact of the prophecy came to pass. The man of God, who yesterday prayed for the soul of the faithful departed, pleaded with God to grant their families, loved ones and the entire nation the fortitude to bear the irreplaceable loss.
