The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SAN) has arraigned one Chidi Nwanyanwu for alleged engine oil adulteration and logo forgery, after being on his trail since 2016. Prosecuting counsel, Mr. Joseph Olofindare, told Justice Maureen Oyetenu of the Federal High Court in Lagos that security agents received intelligence of the defendant’s illicit acts in 2016. He said the defendant ran two companies whose employees rebrand engine lubricants to substandard ones and sell to unsuspecting consumers. He said in the course of investigation, several invitations were extended to him over the years, but he did not honour them until his arrest earlier this month. The agency accused Nwanyanwu and his companies, Ocean Oil Limited and Hi-Power Lubricants, of engaging in engine oil adulteration and inscribing forged SON logos on the products. He was arraigned on a four-count charge, which borders on dealing in adulterated engine oil, non-compliance with SON’s Conformity Assessment Programme (SONCAP) and forging of the SON’s logo, the mark of quality and certification number. Olofindare said the defendants, of No. 21, Kenneth Obas Place Estate, Ojo, Lagos committed the offence at the Trade Fair Administrative Block Complex, Badagry Expressway, Lagos. The offences, according to SON, are punishable under sections Section 26, 26(a) and (b) of the SON Act, 2015, and section 1(18a)(ii) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act, 2004. The defendants pleaded not guilty. Justice Oyetenu ordered Nwanyanwu’s remand at the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (CIID), Ikoyi, Lagos. She adjourned until March 10, 2021, for the hearing of his bail application
