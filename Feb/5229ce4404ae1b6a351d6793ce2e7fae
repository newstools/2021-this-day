Associate Professor Tejumaiye said the production has been approved by the Departmental Board of studies years back with a further directive to print lecturers in charge to properly monitor and supervise the production by the students. His words: “immediately the Department observed the global misfortune which has adversely affected newspaper and magazine business across the world, attention was shifted to the online edition in line with what obtains across the world. “As a foremost Mass Communication training institution in Africa, the Department further re- engineered the training and focus of the students to the various opportunities presented by the online edition in the training of the students.” Tejumaiye further stated that the original plan this year was to release both the hard copies as well as the online editions simultaneously but with Covid-19,the Department rested the hard copies till when they can guarantee the safety and health of the students.
