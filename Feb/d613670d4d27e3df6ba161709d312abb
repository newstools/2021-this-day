By Deji Elumoye The pan Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, has mourned the former Governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Kayode Jakande, who died at the age of 91, saying he served the Centre of Excellence from 1979 to 1983 without greed. The group, in a tribute entitled “Adieu Our LKJ”, issued on Thursday by its National Publicity Secretary, Yinka Odumakin, lauded Jakande, the last of the LOOBO governors, who faithfully implemented the defunct Unity Party of Nigeria’s (UPN) five cardinal programmes in the second republic. Afenifere noted that Jakande’s implementation of the free education programme, especially the phasing out of the shift programme in Lagos schools was swift and revolutionary. The group further stated that: “He served Lagos without greed and covetousness, he never lived in Government House or drove a government car throughout his service to the state. “Jakande developed the Lekki area and never took a plot for himself. His life was all about service. We pray that God will send more of his type our way. Good nite.”
