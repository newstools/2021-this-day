The federal government has handed over about 310 Kano State indigenes out of the 1,319 stranded Nigerians evacuated from Saudi Arabia to the Kano State Government. The Director, Consular and Legal Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Bolaji Akinremi, who received the returnees, noted that their quarantine period has elapsed. The evacuees were quarantined at the FCT hajj camp on arrival from Saudi Arabia where they were remanded at a deportation facility before their evacuation to Nigeria. According to a statement issued yesterday by Mr. Gabriel Odu, an official of the Media, Public Relations and Protocol Unit of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, Akinremi said, “The returnees who were well catered for by the Federal Government have tested negative to coronavirus before being discharged.” Receiving them on behalf of the Kano State Government, the Director General, Kano Investment Promotion Agency and Diaspora, Hajia Hama Mohammed expressed gratitude to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission for their untiring efforts. She gave assurances that the returnees would be rehabilitated and reintegrated into the society. “The state government is ever ready to receive them and make home (Kano) better for them than where they came from through vocational education and skills acquisition,” Mohammed assured.
