Ojuju Calabar was what we used to call masquerades those days in Shomolu. Every masquerade was Ojuju Calabar no matter what tribe it came from and our mothers will be using them to scare us if we refused to retire to bed early. So what I saw the other day on Channels TV was like Ojuju Calabar for me. It was scary and at the same time, amusing. When the masquerades are parading the street, you are afraid and at the same time excited. When it comes towards you, you run away for fear, but you still remain intrigued and keep coming back. I was scared for Amaechi that day o but couldn’t leave the screen cos I was intrigued at Suen’s attempt at pushing him to the wall and his attempt to wriggle out. He was asked about his thoughts on the herdsmen wahala and insecurity as a leader. Amaechi start to move from confidence, fear, arrogance to nonchalance, and finally drag his pretty wife into the matter all to sha escape without being blown up. This Seun is not a normal person o, he kept squeezing, sensing Lord Amaechi’s discomfort. Oga talk na, he would say and Amaechi will be saying please call my wife let me ask her if her chop money has finished. Laugh nearly kill me. I am sure if it was not live TV, Amaechi for stand up and squeeze that yeye Seun ear. How can you attempt to embarrass the Emperor of the South-South? The man building train tracks to the Niger Republic? Who has ever done that ever? Seun listen to me – Amaechi is minister of Transport and not chief of Defence so it is not his job to answer that kind question. If you ask him why keke Marwa is now the official mode of transport for single light-skinned women, now you are asking him question within his purview. But asking him that kind question is like na PDP send you. Kai, Seun you need to go back to NUJ o. My brother, you need to calm down abeg. Lol.
