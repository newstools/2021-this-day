Fulham winger Ademola Lookman has stressed that he is not looking at his goals and assists this season ahead of the London derby against Crystal Palace on Sunday. With four goals and three assists to his name, the 2017 U20 World Cup winner is statistically Fulham’s most decisive player in the top-flight but he’s not bothered by such stats and more concerned about the bigger picture. “I don’t look like stuff like that, for me it’s just all about improving every single day I can, learn as much as I can off the gaffer and off the coaching staff,” Lookman said to FFCtv. “I’m enjoying my football here, that’s the most important thing.” After a tough run that saw the Cottagers play three games in six days, they have a similar run coming up with matches against Crystal Palace, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool in a space of seven days, starting with Sunday’s derby against the Eagles. On what he’s expecting from Palace, Lookman said : “Another tough challenge, you know Palace is a very tough team to play against. “We need to be at the top of our game also but we’ll definitely be going there to get the three points like in any game that we are going to play this season.” Scott Parker’s team will move out of the relegation zone with a win against Crystal Palace and Newcastle United lose at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers.
