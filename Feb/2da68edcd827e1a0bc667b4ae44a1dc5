By Kuni Tyessi A herbal expert, Rotimi Emmanuel of the Best Safety Enterprise, has produced herbal mixtures which have proven to be effective in the treatment of waist pain, low sugar, irregular menstruation, diarrhoea and malaria. At the launch of the products namely 7G- Davido Extra Data and 4G, in Abuja, Emmanuel, said the mixtures which are mainly from palmwine are without ethanol which is dangerous to the human body when abused. He said: “People who consume too much of groundnut oil, especially women who suffer irregular menstruation can use this product as it has proven to be 100 per cent efficacious. What it does, is that it flushes it out. “For men, it cures waist pain and diarrhea. In women, if there’s too much of sugar in their system, it has been proven that the passage of the monthly flow can be blocked. This herbal medicine has proven to be effective as it can completely flush the system of excess sugar for proper flow. “No side effects except when consumed in excess because it has elements of alcohol. Just a dose will do.” He said using the names 7G and 4G which is primarily to draw the attention of the public to the importance and use of herbs is also to make a statement indicating that such names are not solely attributed to networks but also to products known to improve total well-being. He urged the government to come to the aid of companies that produce herbs that cure and with living testimonies as evidence. “We are enlightening the general public about the dangers of consuming alcohol by ethanol. If people must consume alcohol, it should be the one made from palmwine and without ethanol. “Ethanol kills the body system faster. We try to encourage people to avoid anything with ethanol. “We work hard and buckle right. We need the federal government to help the companies that produce herbs that cure. If you go deeply, you will discover that we have thousands of testimonies everywhere about the efficacy of herbal medicine.”
