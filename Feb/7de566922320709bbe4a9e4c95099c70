The need to contribute its quota to the development of the creative industry in Nigeria has warranted the establishment of Africa Photography Organisation (AFPHOR), a channel through which Investment One Financial Services Limited seeks to identify endowed creative persons to empower them. The company, one of Nigeria’s leading financial services outfits, in a statement said, AFPHOR is an indication that it is willing to delve into areas other than finances to enhance the life of Nigerians. “Though we are a financial company, we want to go beyond providing finances. And whether you like it or not, your lifestyle intertwines with your finances. Yes, we want to help you grow your wealth and give insight into doing it yourself, however, we are also trying to see how we can expand our horizon into lifestyle and we feel the best way to do it is through arts,” the Company spokesperson, Uwa Omole, disclosed. She noted that the Company had the appreciation for photography, arts, nature, and other things that will make people know that its scope goes beyond finance. “We believe the best way to propagate financial literacy is to go into other fields and educate them about finance and investment.” AFPHOR held the first edition of its annual photography event where a winner emerged from the amateur category. The winner, Mr. Shaka Ehimen, a student of Architecture from the Ambrose Ali University, Edo State, picked the star prize of N570,000 about $1,500 at the event that held at the Virtual Hub Centre, Ikeja , Lagos recently
