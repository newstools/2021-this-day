The new time-based plans will allow customers to stream their favourite YouTube videos for as low as N50 per hour.

A fair usage policy on each of the plans with fixed volume will be applied, the company stated. “These new plans have been uniquely developed so that each price pack has a streaming time allocated to it. For example, on the N50 plan the customer can use the 1-hour streaming in sections of 10 minutes or 20 minutes, all within 1-day”, Globacom added.
