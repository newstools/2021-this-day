Former minister visits Jonathan By Chuks Okocha Former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode yesterday insisted that he was still a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The former Presidential spokesman also disclosed that he visited former President Goodluck Jonathan. The Governor of Kogi State, Mr. Yahaya Bello, had earlier disclosed in a viral video that emerged yesterday that Fani-Kayode had defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The former minister had on Monday met with Bello and the National Chairman of the APC, Governor Mai Buni of Yobe State. Their meeting led to speculation that he had defected to the ruling party. Bello confirmed the speculation to be true, in the viral video, saying, “Our brother and friend, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode has joined our party in good faith. He’s joining our party to add his own positive energy and make contribution into ensuring that APC is a party to beat.” “Remember that Chief Femi Fani-Kayode was a foundation member of this great party. Due to misunderstanding, he decided to port elsewhere, now he has decided to join our party, approached me, and by the mandate given to me by the party, I must not segregate or discriminate against any individual.” But in a swift reaction, Fani-Kayode admitted that he was indeed holding talks across party lines but insisted that he has not left the PDP. “Though we have had meetings across party lines and we are in a season of political consultation, I have not left the PDP,” he wrote yesterday on his verified Twitter handle. Fani-Kayode has also disclosed that he visited former President Jonathan in his Abuja residence on Tuesday. “My team and I had the honour and privilege of spending a wonderful evening with President Goodluck Jonathan in his Abuja home last night. None like him,” the minister tweeted yesterday. He did not reveal the details of the meeting with the former president.
