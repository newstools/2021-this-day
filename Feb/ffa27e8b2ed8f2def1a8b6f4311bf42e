Sylvester Idowu in Warri The factional leader of the Host Communities of Nigeria Producing Oil and Gas (HOSTCOM), Dr. Mike Emuh, has said the people of the Niger Delta misconstrued the 2.5 percent equity proposed for the host communities in the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) 2020. aintained that the proposed 2.5 equity for the host communities is the best thing to happen to Niger Deltans as a people in the region. According to him, the percentage will be calculated based on oil production per each flow station in a community, insisting that it is a welcome idea that receives his support. For instance, Emuh gave his community, Olomoru in Delta State as an example where he said it has 15 flow stations, and imagined the amount of funds that will accrued for the development of the area. In a conversation with THISDAY yesterday, he said: “The 2.5 percent will be the best thing to happen us. Our people don’t understand the proposition in that proposed bill. If they do, they won’t oppose it for now.” Emuh, however, said though he wasn’t against the clamour for 10 percent equity as being agitated by some stakeholders in the region, his position is stemmed from the fact of other benefits coming to the region. “On the PIB, we are saying 10 per cent equity was the executive bill that was signed by late President Yar’Adua, but if it is 1.5 percent, we will take it for now rather than scrapping other intervention by the federal government for the development of the region,” he said. The HOSTCOM national chairman described those agitating for the scrapping of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) as the enemy of the region. “Why would they want NDDC to be scrapped? Is it because of the 1.5 percent equity for the development of the host communities? No. Those agitating for that are the enemies of the region,” Emuh said.
