By Peter Uzoho The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) said it is upgrading the Nigerian oil and gas downstream operations to global standards with improved technology in its ongoing automation process. The Director of DPR, Mr. Sarki Auwalu, stated this at a virtual meeting with the members of the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) on Tuesday. In a statement signed by the agencyâ€™s Head of Public Affairs, Mr. Paul Osu, the director said the department was deploying appropriate technology to enhance value for operators and investors alike in the downstream sector. Auwalu said the DPR has concluded plans to launch the the Downstream Remote Monitoring Systems (DRMS), an inventory and regulatory tool designed to track product levels across retail outlets and depots using the short code- *7117#. Noting that the DRMS would be launched on Thursday in Abuja, the DPR director added that the introduction of DRMS would create value for the sector by providing access to data for efficient management of their operations. Auwalu assured that DPR, as partners in progress, would continue to engage with MOMAN to ensure seamless communication and feedback on our regulatory activities. He said the agency has developed a framework around quality, quantity, integrity and safety (QQIS) for petroleum products in response to the current situation of price freedom in the downstream sector. He lauded the support of MOMAN for the gas expansion programme of government and advised the association to ensure their members compliance with the gas add-on directives for their stations as they are the energy bridge of the nation. On his part, the Chairman of MOMAN, Mr. Tunji Oyebanji, assured the DPR of the readiness of the association to always partner with the department for the development and growth of the downstream sector.
