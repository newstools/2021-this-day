By Vanessa Obioha With less than three weeks to the much-anticipated 2021 MTV Africa Music Awards (MAMA), MTV Base has announced the postponement of the award.
“MTV Base is postponing the 2021 MTV Africa Music Awards,” read a statement by the media organisation. The award which would be returning after a four-year hiatus was billed for February 20, in Kampala, Uganda. Although it was to be a virtual ceremony, plans were underway to make it a grand event. Nominees across the 20 categories were released last December where Nigerian talents like Burna Boy, Wizkid, Yemi Alade and Davido scoop nominations. In January, American hip-hop sensation and record producer DJ Khaled was announced as the international host while Tanzanian Diamond Platnumz, South Africa’s Nasty C, Kenya’s Khaligraph Jones and Wizkid were among the lined-up acts to perform at the event. Calls to postpone the MAMAs have been echoing in the last few months, particularly after the arrest of Nigerian music stars Omah Lay and Tems in Uganda. The ongoing political tension in the country following the re-election of President Yoweri Museveni has also amplified that clamour. No specific date has been disclosed on when the award is likely to return but organisers disclosed that they “will keep fans updated as we have more news.”
