All through the year, several programmes would be held to celebrate various strands of her blessed life. Some events will also be staged in partnership with other organisations.’’ It was also revealed that the 7-day Lagos Book and Art Festival LABAF will be dedicated to Ajai-Lycett. It will be a comprehensive open-air carnivalesque feast of life and ideas parading a mixed grill of artistic and cultural events.
