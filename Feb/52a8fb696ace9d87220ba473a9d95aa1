Vanessa Obioha After a one year-hiatus caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the largest gathering of entertainment industry professionals in Nigeria, Nigerian Entertainment Conference (NECLive) is returning. This time, it will be a hybrid media event combining a studio set-up of select speakers with live global broadcast across cable TV, radio and online platforms. Scheduled for April 25, the eighth edition of NECLive will explore the theme ‘Building The Future’, focusing on the various ways entertainment can serve as a vehicle, creativity as a tool and celebrity power as an agent of change to build a remarkable future for Nigeria’s youth. Three main speakers who are leading the charge in rethinking the approach to consumer entertainment and creative enterprise across the world will be featured while entertainment includes a live music performance by one of Nigeria’s most celebrated artistes, an enthralling live stage drama and comedy from one of the industry’s finest. “We set up NECLive eight years ago as an intervention towards building the industry of our dreams. Seven events, 450 speakers and panellists, 40 exhibitions and brands, and 12,000 attendees after, we are glad to be witnessing and facilitating the transformation of our home entertainment; or our music and media. And we are calling on the government, practitioners, fans and investors to come to the party,” said convener Ayeni Adekunle. This year’s edition will also mark the launch of two special products from the conference: NECLive Go and NECLive TV Special. The former is a platform created to support innovators that are solving growth problems for creatives and the wider entertainment industry in Nigeria while the latter is a scripted 90-minute long production, featuring a 7-year chronicle of the most powerful speakers and memorable moments from the NECLive stage between 2013 and 2020.
