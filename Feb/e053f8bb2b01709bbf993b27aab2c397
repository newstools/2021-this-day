By Adedayo Akinwale The House of Representatives has lamented that the ongoing membership registration and revalidation exercise of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has stalled the consideration of the Electoral Act amendment reports submitted by its committee. The spokesperson of the House, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, while briefing journalists yesterday in Abuja, said the report would have been considered by the House but was stepped down because some lawmakers, who are members of the ruling party, travelled for the exercise. The APC commenced the exercise on February 9, 2021, across the 36 states of the federation, but later extended it by three weeks, and would now end of the exercise on March 31, 2021. He stated: “As you all know, the report is ready; it was tabled for presentation yesterday (Tuesday), but due to the fact that most members wanted the report to come in and be considered the same day, as the House needed to be full to be able to do that. “As you are aware, most members are in their various constituencies now, especially the members of APC, doing the membership drive, and if we consider the report and you cut out some members who are supposed to be there to see the provisions of the report on that particular bill, we are doing a disservice to the people that they represent. In the wisdom of the leadership of the House, the House decided to suspend it until we are able to have a fuller house to be able to do the consideration. “ Kalu assured Nigerians that the House would prioritise the Electoral Act considering the fact that time is of the essence. He further revealed that the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) probe report was ready, and it has been submitted to the House by the committee, as he assured Nigerians that the report would be considered also.
