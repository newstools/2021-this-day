Rev. Mother Esther Abimbola Ajayi, without a doubt, is one of Nigeriaâ€™s most accomplished Christian leaders and notable clerics. Ajayi, the founder of the fast-growing Love of Christ Generation (C & S) Church, one of the biggest white garment churches on Clapham Road, South East London, has continued to win souls into the vineyard of God through her spiritual fervour. And the church, with the active support of her husband, Ademuyiwa Ajayi, has grown in leaps and bounds. Besides, Iya Aladura, as she is fondly called, is loved by all for her uncommon generosity.
But in recent times, she seems to have also developed an interest in real estate, as evident in her acquisition of a large expanse of land in the Lekki axis of Lagos, where she has partly erected and now completed a megachurch complex. It was gathered that, but for the COVID-19 induced lockdown, the state-of-the-art worship centre that can sit thousands would have been opened and dedicated with fanfare last July.
The Lagos-born preacher had donated a building to the Lagos State Police Command Special Protection Unit in Ikeja a few weeks ago. To further confirm her newfound passion, ever-smiling Iya Adura has bought a 4-floor-facility located off Obafemi Awolowo Way, which is said to be undergoing renovation.
