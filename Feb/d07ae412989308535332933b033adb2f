By Kuni Tyessi The federal government has announced the conclusion of its plans to build state-of-the-art digital schools and facilities for learning across the country. The Executive Secretary of the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), Dr. Hamid Bobboyi, disclosed this during the inauguration ceremony of basic education projects at the Federal University Dutse, Jigawa State. In a statement signed by the commission’s Head of Communications, Mr. David Apeh, the executive secretary added that a digital resource centre is also being constructed in Abuja to coordinate digital learning in the basic education sub-sector. When completed, he stressed that the facilities would put the sub-sector on the digital map of the world. According to Bobboyi, “Basic education as you are aware is the foundation upon which our education is built. If this pillar is weak, then all other tiers cannot stand.” He explained that UBEC has tried in the last four years to work with all stakeholders in the education sector to change the narrative of basic education delivery in the country. Commenting on the partnership with the Federal University Dutse (FUD), he said it represents a strategic engagement which would yield mutual benefit to both FUD and UBEC, and would help to re-enforce and strengthen the basic education sub-sector in Nigeria. Earlier in her welcome address, the Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof Fatima Batulu Mukhtar, thanked the executive secretary, board and management of UBEC for the primary school project and the early childhood care development and education (ECCDE) centre in the university. She said while the facility provides easy access to basic education for many within and outside the university, “it would serve as a demonstration school and a centre of excellence which shall impact positively in the development of basic education in Jigawa State.”
