Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has warned the leadership of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and their members to stay away from all parks and garages in the state to avoid incurring the full wrath of the law. In a statement issued in Abeokuta yesterday by the state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Alhaji AbdulWaheed Odusile, the state government said the warning became necessary in view of intelligence reports by the security agencies that the union is planning to resume collection of dues and revenues on behalf of the government at the motor parks and garages in the state, against the existing decision of the government banning the activities of the NURTW in all the motor parks and garages in the State. “It will be recalled that following crisis in the leadership of the NURTW in the State that threatened security of lives and properties, particularly public transport in the State, the House of Assembly in June 2020 passed a resolution suspending the activities of the union in the State. The government subsequently banned the activities of the union in all motor parks and garages in the State,” the statement said further. “Security agencies have been given firm directive to arrest and prosecute any operative of the NURTW or indeed anyone, group or association that has not been approved by the government to act on its behalf that attempts to defy the decision of the government or test its resolve to maintain peace and security in all parts of the state, including the motor parks. Unlike what obtained in the past, this administration has been methodical and deliberate in its approach to maintain peace at the motor parks as well as management of transport union activities, and will not allow anyone to undermine the prevailing peaceful environment”, the statement concluded
