By Segun James First Civilian Governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Kayode Jakande, is dead. He was aged 91.  His death was announced Thursday in a Facebook post by  governor of Lagos State, Mr.  Babajide Sanwo-Olu.  ”With gratitude to God for a worthy life well spent in the service of Lagos State, Nigeria and humanity, I announce the death of a venerable statesman, outstanding politician, public administrator and the first Civilian Governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Kayode Jakande,” Sanwo-Olu said. Born on July 23, 1929, Jakande served as governor of Lagos in the Second Republic from 1979 to1983. He also served as Minister of Works in the military regime of Late Gen. Sani Abacha.  His administration as governor of Lagos state is still revered for the massive infrastructure development recorded during his four-year stint, especially the numerous Jakande Estates built across many local governments in the state as well as sterling investment in schools.  He was also reputed to have built the Lagos State Government Secretariat at Alausa.  Jakande’s death comes just about a month after a former Military Governor of Lagos, Rear Admiral Ndubuisi Kanu, passed away.
