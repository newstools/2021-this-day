By Deji Elumoye President Muhammadu Buhari has lauded the nation’s security and intelligence agencies and Niger state government for their roles in the release of the abducted students of Government Science College, Kagara in Niger State. The President, in a statement on Saturday morning by his Media Assistant, Garba Shehu, in welcoming the release of the abducted students expressed happiness over the development.
“We are happy they have been released” said President Buhari, who also greatly sympathized with the staff and the students, their parents and friends on this ordeal.
He, however, warned that the nation will not continue to suffer these attacks that threaten the growth of education, the security and life of the future leaders at the same time putting the nation in a negative light. The President reiterated his earlier advice to school owners, particularly the state and local governments as well as religious organizations, to scale up security around their schools in line with the standards laid down by the UN-backed Safe School Programme of the administration.
He once again condemned the school abductions, with latest one at the Government Girls Secondary School, Jangebe in Zamfara State, and directed all security and intelligence agencies in the country to hunt down the culprits and bring them to justice.
