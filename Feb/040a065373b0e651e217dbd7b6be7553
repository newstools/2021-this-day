Segun Awofadeji in Bauchi Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has been called upon to urgently fish out all those involved in the crisis at Shasha area of Ibadan, the state capital, and prosecute them according to the laws of the land, to serve as deterrent to others who want to do same thing. The call was made by the Convener of Northern Youth Consultative Initiative (NYCI), Bappare Mohammed, who spoke to selected journalists yesterday, saying: “The attack on innocent Hausa men last Saturday at Shasha community of Oyo State is condemned by all men of good conscience and conviction.” Mohammed stated that: “It should be noted that on several fora, the leadership of Northern Youth Consultative Initiative has been calling for sincere unity of Nigerians irrespective of ethnic or religious affiliation.” He, however, lamented that: “But calls of such manner has conspicuously been hindered from thriving by merchants of violence that are hell-bent on fanning the embers of crisis and disunity for their selfish gains. “Attack of such magnitude will eminently cause reprisal across the country, which shall bring nothing but bloodbaths across the country. “Therefore, we urge Governor Makinde and other governors whose states are bedeviled with serious security threats to do everything possible to prosecute culprits and sponsors of these unfortunate incidents. The unity of Nigeria is sacrosanct. “Finally, we implore Northern youths to remain calm and law-abiding by not taking laws into their hands. Nigeria is ours; we have no any other place on earth more than our dear country.”
