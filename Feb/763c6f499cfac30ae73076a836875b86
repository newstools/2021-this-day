The Group Managing Director, FBN Holdings Plc, Mr. UK Eke, had last year told shareholders that the long-term strategy of the group was ultimately geared towards ensuring that FBN Holdings becomes one of the foremost financial services institutions in sub-Saharan Africa. He assured shareholders that the strategy to reposition the Group was gathering momentum and the key pain points, including the challenging delinquent loan portfolio, have been effectively addressed except for the need to intensify efforts at reducing their cost to serve. “Now that we are on course for a normalised non-performing loan (NPL) territory in 2020 and with our leadership position in electronic channels, the Group is positioned to take advantage of the evolving opportunities in the market for the benefit of our esteemed shareholders,” Eke said.
