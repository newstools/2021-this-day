Chief Executive Officer of Monimichelle, Ebi Egbe, has given a pat on the back to Governor Duoye Diri of Bayelsa State over how he is reposition sports in the state. Egbe said at the weekend that he was impressed with the decision of the governor to throw his weight behind Bayelsa United as the club step up preparations to participate in the Nigerian National League (NNL) which kicks off next week. Gov Diri had last week ordered the immediate reconstitution of the board of both Bayelsa United and Bayelsa Queens, even as he equally bought brand new buses for both teams. “Gov Diri has shown he wants sports to thrive in Bayelsa State. I want to thank him for taking steps that would see Bayelsa United do well in the NNL and gain promotion to the elite class of the nation’s domestic league. “The governor has also given a lot of support to wrestling which is one sport which Bayelsa has dominated over the years. “My appeal is that he should also ensure that the facilities at the Samson Siasia Stadium do not rot away. That arena remains the only place where sports can take place in the whole of Bayelsa for now. It needs proper maintenance,” Egbe concluded.
