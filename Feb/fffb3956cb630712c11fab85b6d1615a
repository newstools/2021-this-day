By Ibrahim Shuaibu The Kano State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has petitioned the Inspector General of Police (IG), Mohammed Adamu, seeking the prosecution of the state All Progressives Congress (APC) Chairman, Abdullahi Abbas, over allegation of hate speech. The Chairman of the state PDP, Shehu Wada Sagagi, said yesterday that they have drafted a letter to the IG and other relevant government agencies. According to him, “To us it is an empty threat that will not deter the good people of Kano State from voting for their choice. However, for the interest of pure democracy, such unguarded utterances need to be addressed.” Abbas had previously made similar statements considered by the opposition party in the state as provocative. “We are not surprised because it has been his nature to make such inciting utterances. This is hate speech,” the state PDP chairman said. Last Friday, during the swearing-in ceremony of the 44 local government areas chairmen in the state, Abbas alleged: “Attack and punish anybody you see trying to steal votes during the election in 2023. Take stiffer action into your hands and nothing will be done. I have ordered you to punish anybody seen before ballots boxes trying to rig the election, this is my punishment, and nothing will happen. “I call on our party youths to keep their weapons for now as there will be a better time to use them.” This is not the first time the APC caretaker chairman was inciting the party supporters to go violent during voting, as it could be recalled that while opening the revalidation exercise of the party (APC), he warned that they would take punitive measures against anybody who is against their party. Similarly, sometime last year, Abbas was quoted as saying that they would take action against anybody who tried to repeat what had happened during the conduct of the state gubernatorial election in 2019.
