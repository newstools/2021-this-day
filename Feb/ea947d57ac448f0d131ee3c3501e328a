A fortnight ago, a former military administrator of Lagos State, Brigadier-General Mohammed Buba Marwa, was appointed the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) by President Muhammadu Buhari and since then, there’s been an all-different feel in the agency. Talk about capacity, dedication and commitment to results, Marwa has never been found wanting, often capping this with professionalism. For all that he touches, he always leaves behind a mark – of honour and hard work for posterity. News of different arrests by officials of the drug enforcement agency since Marwa took charge has renewed hope that with the right people in the right places, Nigeria could get back her groove. It’s only a question of time! It may seem early for such profiling in the reckoning of some people. However, where the principles of sanctions and reward are held dear, it is just spot-on. Although Marwa has just begun and the room for more positive impressions is nearly endless, identifying such feats as they come and motivating him to do more is the way to go. Indeed, at NDLEA, a new sheriff is in town!
