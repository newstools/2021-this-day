He said:”We all know what this service is established to do. It’s clear to us . The number of people who come into Nigeria through the land border is becoming alarming. “knowing your efforts to secure our borders, we are worried about some foreigners that come in and are almost permanent in our forest reserve. I know a number of criminal activities that are being perpetrated in our reserves that are done by foreigners. “Yes! Foreigners. They might be Fulanis but they are not Nigerians. I think there must be collaborations. Collaborations with other security agencies. That way you can function well and achieve more result. Collaborate with security agency like Amotekun. “Peace is very important to us, not only in the Southwest or Ondo state but peace in the country. All over the country we are being ravaged by foreigners.” Earlier in her address, Amahian appreciated the governor for the cordial relationship between him and the immigration service.
