Okon Bassey in Uyo A High Court in Akwa Ibom State has sentenced one Edem Tom Etuk in Itu Local Government Area of the state to one month imprisonment for disobeying a court order. The court sitting in Itu at the weekend sentenced Etuk to prison in accordance with Section 287 sub 3 of the 1999 Constitution as amended. In the judgement, the court, which was presided over by Justice Ntong Ntong, convicted the contemnor and sentenced him without any option of fine. Justice Ntong further held that after the jail term, the convict shall continue to be in prison custody until he purges himself of the contempt by writing an undertaking to obey the court order, and until the order is set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction. He said time has come for the citizens, no matter how highly or lowly placed, to obey court orders in order to enhance and safeguard the rule of law in a democratic society. The Judge said no one is above the law, and that the majesty of the court must be jealously protected by every authority and person. The West Itam District Court had in 2015 delivered a judgement ordering the convict to vacate a piece of land on Atiku Abubakar Avenue in Uyo, the state capital. The convict refused to obey the order and equally refused to appeal the matter in a higher court.
