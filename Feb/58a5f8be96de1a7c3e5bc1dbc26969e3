The news of your new bundle of joy has reached the honourable Duke of Shomolu with glee. Congratulations to my favourite couple. Please, as soon as the baby is 30 days you bring him here. Let me give him his Shomolu names â€“ Akanimo, Ndifreka, Oluwatobilola. These names you will put in his birth certificate with the names you will give him. I will pay you N2,000 and give you a bottle of Schnapps and six kola nuts. Congratulations, once again. He will be king.
