The Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has arraigned two officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) over alleged extortion of motorists. The two officials, John Asegu and Otom Asueni, were brought before Justice H. Aprioku of the Rivers State High Court 11 sitting in Port Harcourt on two-count of extortion and gratification. ICPC, according to a statement issued yesterday, told the court how the duo forcibly collected various sums of money totaling N3,500 from motorists as a “fee“ to allow the motorists pass their checkpoint along Port Harcourt-Ahoada expressway, even without being charged for any traffic offence. The Commission also accused the defendants of using their position as public officers to confer undue advantage upon themselves by soliciting for, and accepting gratification. The defendants were arrested on the act after ICPC mounted a sting operation on them following intelligence. ICPC in a Charge No: PHC/3905ICPC/19 averred that the duo’s actions were contrary to and punishable under sections 8, 19, and 26 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000, and if they are found guilty they shall on conviction, be liable to imprisonment for seven years without option of fine. The accused persons pleaded not guilty to the charges and were granted them bail. They were, however, remanded in prison because of their inability to meet up with the bail conditions. The case was adjourned to the 26th of March, 2021 for commencement of trial.
