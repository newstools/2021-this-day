By Udora Orizu The Minority Caucus in the House of Representatives has congratulated former Minister of Finance, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, for her successful emergence as the Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) despite all the hurdles. The caucus, in a statement by the Minority Leader, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, on Monday observed that the emergence of Okonjo-Iweala as DG of the world trade body has reinforced global confidence in international consensus and recognition of competence and proficiency over provincial considerations. The lawmakers charged Okonjo Iweala to hit the ground running and bring to bear her skills, connections and wealth of experience in the task of leading the WTO at this trying period in the history of global economy. The caucus also urged her to have a special focus on Africa and the developing world, particularly at this time of economic recession, which has been worsened by the adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The statement read: ”Indeed, the election of Dr. Okonjo-Iweala to head the WTO is well-deserving, given her wealth of experience, competence, commitment and track record of performance in global finance and economy as evinced in her successes as Nigeria’s minister of finance, Managing Director of the World Bank and various other international development bodies. “We commend the global community for having confidence in Dr. Okonjo Iweala and particularly, the United States President, His Excellency Joe Biden, for the unwavering support given to her by his administration, which is clearly in recognition of Dr. Okonjo-Iweala’s competence.”
