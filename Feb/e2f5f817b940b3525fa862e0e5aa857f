CD Leganes defender Kenneth Omeruo has said that he expects a tough face-off against fellow Nigeria forward Sadiq Umar when their Spanish clubs do battle in a midweek clash tonight. Poor weather forced this La Liga 2 match to be re-arranged for Wednesday. A win for Sadiq Umar’s UD Almeria in Madrid will see them shoot to the top of the table, while victory for the home team will consolidate their fourth place. “The game will be a tough one,” Omeruo told SCORENigeriayesterday “We have to recover properly for this game. “Almeria are enjoying a good run right now, but so are we – we have won our last three games under a new coach. “We are home and we have to take this opportunity. “With the new coach, we have somehow found a better way to approach games and it is working for us. “We are going for a win,” stressed Omeruo. The top two teams in Segunda Division will automatically win promotion to La Liga, while the teams who placed third to sixth will feature in a playoff. UD Almería haven’t been in Spain’s top division since the 2014/15 season, but the club from the sourthern city of the same name are serious contenders for promotion in 2020/21. Kaduna-born Umar Sadiq, 24, is perhaps the most important factor in Almeria’s push, and with 11 LaLiga goals this season has propelled the club into third place in the LaLiga SmartBank. Sadiq’s presence in Almeria is down to the sporting project laid out by Turki Al-Sheikh, who took over the club in 2019. The club is committed to signing some of the best talent around, no matter whether from Spain or abroad. They currently boast the second youngest squad in the division, yet also one of the most valuable. Having just turned 24, Sadiq is oddly enough one of the oldest in the squad. He’s also one of the club’s most expensive ever signings, after his multi-million Euro transfer from Partizan Belgrade last summer. There was a lot of pressure on his shoulders this season, with a lot expected of him, but he is thriving.
