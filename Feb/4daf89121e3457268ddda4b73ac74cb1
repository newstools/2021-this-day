The draw for the 2021 U-17 Africa Cup of Nations has been conducted with Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets placed in Group B. The five-time world champions qualified for the competition after finishing second behind Côte d’Ivoire at the West Africa Football Union competition in Togo. At the draw ceremony held on Wednesday afternoon, Nigeria was placed in group B alongside Algeria, Tanzania and Congo. Group A consists of host, Morocco, Uganda and Côte d’Ivoire while Group C has Cameroon, Senegal, Mali and South Africa. Semifinalists of this year’s competition will not participate at the World Cup as the governing body (FIFA) has announced there won’t be U17 World Cup this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Nigeria finished in 4th position in the last edition of the tournament that was held in Tanzania but qualified to play at the 2019 FIFA U17 World Cup in Brazil. The competition in Morocco is slated to start on 13th of March and run through the end of the month.
