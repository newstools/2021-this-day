By Bennett Oghifo U.S. Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard on Monday unveiled the U.S. Consulate General’s reference-grade Air Quality Monitor, effectively linking Nigeria to air quality index information and health messaging from the United States’ Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The monitor supplies data to the ZephAir app, which is free to download on Apple and Google Play Stores. Ambassador Leonard, who is optimistic that the new equipment will enhance the Consulate’s capacity to provide reliable data on air quality, highlighted the United States’ commitment to environmental sustainability. “Through a team effort, we have successfully procured air quality monitors for Embassy Abuja and Consulate Lagos through the Greening Diplomacy Initiative’s Department of State’s Air program. This will strengthen our ability to collect and share reliable data on air quality as it corresponds to the time of the day and the seasons of the year.” Ambassador Leonard observed. “We are proud to contribute to Nigeria’s efforts to protect the environment and improve human health. The Mission will continue to promote environmental policies that balance environmental protection and economic growth,” she said. The U.S. Department of State’s 65 -plus air quality monitors, which are housed at U.S. Embassies and Consulates across the world, are made in the United States to Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) specifications, as delineated by the Clean Air Act. Nigeria now hosts one monitor each in the U.S. Embassy, Abuja and the U.S. Consulate General, Lagos. Air quality information from the monitors is available on the ZephAir app, and at https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates/#Nigeria$Lagos
