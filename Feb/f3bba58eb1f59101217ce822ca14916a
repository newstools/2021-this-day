By Laleye Dipo The kidnapped Kagara school boys, their teachers and some of their relations are now back in Minna. They were brought into the state capital in three buses at about 9.06am accompanied by heavily armed policemen. The victims, released on the orders of the state Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, were taken to the Niger State Development Company (NSDC) Hotel opposite the Government House for profiling, medical treatment and feeding. One of the female abductees was rushed to the General Hospital for treatment because her health condition was critical. A source said she was fatigued and had swollen legs probably as a result of the long trek from where they were kept to the point the police rescued them. Pressmen and relations of the victims were not allowed into the NSDC Hotel, where they were kept, but one of the parents, Mr. John Paiko, who gave his son’s name as Emma, gave glory to God for the release of his son. “The principal called me to come to Minna that my son has been released,” Paiko, a father of three, said, adding that Emma is the only child that has gone to school among his children. He however vowed that the development will not stop him from returning him (Emma) to the same school to continue his education. Emma, 19 year old, is in SS2 Governor Bello will receive the victims at 2pm today before handing them over to their relations.
