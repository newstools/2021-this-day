Wema Bank has set out to creatively offer its customers a pre-paid gift card, as a means of gifting its loved ones with something remarkable this season. According to a statement, the bank decided to roll out the easy-to-gift items in order to encourage its customers not to hold back from showing love both in cash and kind to those they care for. It stated that to promote the tradition of gift-giving that accompanies the valentine season, “Wema Bank is offering customers a special gift option to share with their loved ones and embarking on a love fiesta of their own: the *945# love campaign.” Members of her online community would win giveaways including goody bags, airtime recharge, purchase discounts and cash prizes. Commenting on the prepaid gift card initiative, Wema Bank’s Head, Channels, Damola Bolodeoku said: “We are well aware that during this season a lot of people, including our customers worry about what to get their loved ones. “As such, this compelled us to help them find a solution, therefore offering them a perfect gift such as this. Not only does this card take away what is sometimes a tedious experience in looking for the perfect gift for a loved one but considering the ongoing pandemic and the limitations in movement, we believe it is most convenient in these times.”
