Google has announced a number of initiatives across Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa to keep children and families safe online. Aligning with the theme of this year’s global Safer Internet Day, “Together for a better Internet”, Google teamed up with several organisations across the continent to boost education efforts and develop programmes around online safety. Announcing the initiatives, Country Director, Google Nigeria, Juliet Ehimuan, said: “With an estimated 346 million internet users that came online for the first time in the last year, and 376 million new social media users, there is no better time for us to help people stay safe online. “We are working with non-profits and social enterprises to advance their work through Google.org’s Africa Online Safety Fund, while also working with educational institutions and governments across sub-Saharan Africa in order to have a greater impact.” Administered as part of the Africa Online Safety Fund, the initiative gave a grant to Impact Amplifier and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, to run an open call across the continent to find the most innovative and impactful nonprofit organisations operating in this space. In all, 26 social impact organisations across nine African countries were selected to receive grants of up to $100,000 each. The five selected in Nigeria include Epower, LagosMums, Velma Foundation, Hive Creative Guild and Teens Can Code. This funding will be used to boost projects that work to combat online vulnerabilities, disinformation and extremism aimed at children, the youth, families, schools and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).
