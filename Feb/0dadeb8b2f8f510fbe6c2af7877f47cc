By Udora Orizu The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has described the death of a former governor of Lagos State, Alhaji Lateef Jakande, as a monumental loss. The Speaker, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Lanre Lasisi, said he was personally touched by the death of Jakande, whom he said was a man of peace, who lived all his life serving humanity. He said the former governor would be sorely missed by the people, especially Lagosians, and that he would be remembered for his developmental strides in the state. Gbajabiamila said, ”Lateef Jakande’s death is a personal loss to me, because he was a father to us all. A strong political ally to my mother, Alhaja Lateefat Gbajabiamila. We will never forget the role he played in the economic and political existence of Lagos State, especially when he served as governor between 1979 and 1983. “Baba Jakande touched the lives of many people in different ways. His major preoccupation was the peace and unity of his people, and he lived by that example. As a politician, he was a nationalist, and as a foremost journalist, he was a patriot to a fault. When he later served as Minister of Works between 1993 and 1998, he did so diligently and with a lot of dedication. I pray that the Almighty Allah comforts his family at this difficult moment. May Jannatul Firdaus be his final abode.”
