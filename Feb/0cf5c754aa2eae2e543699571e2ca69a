Commenting on the performance, Group Managing Director, UACN, Fola Aiyesimoju, said: “FY 2020 was challenging, with operational disruptions related to COVID-19 and ENDSARS protests. I thank my colleagues across the group for their courage, sacrifice, and dedication in navigating complexity. We focused on executing our strategy, implementing initiatives relating to UACN Property Development Company Plc (UPDC), significantly reducing leverage and increasing cash, strengthening management, and driving profitability.” According to him, operating performance for the year was negatively impacted by disruptions as well as input cost escalation. “Our efforts resulted in net income of N4.3 billion in 2020. We benefited from N1.2 billion in non-recurring gains from investments in associates, MDS Logistics Limited and UPDC. In the fourth quarter, our businesses rebounded and profit after tax increased 136 per cent to N2.4 billion (N1.4billion, adjusting for non-recurring items) from N1.0 billion in 2019, supported by cost management initiatives that reduced operating expenses by N1.4billion(30 per cent).In December 2020, UAC received 649 million units of UPDC Real Estate Investment Trust , valued at N3.6 billion as part of the partial exit from UPDC.
