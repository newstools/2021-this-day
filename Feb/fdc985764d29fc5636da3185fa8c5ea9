Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano Kano State Government has shut down 10 boarding schools in the outskirts of the metropolis. The state Commissioner for Education, Muhammad Sunusi Kiru, disclosed this in a short audio message over the radio stations in the state yesterday night. The Education Commissioner said the closure became necessary due to the rising number of abductions of school children in neighbouring states. The closed schools are situated at Ajingi, Sumaila, Jogana, Kafin Maiyaki, Gaya, amongst others. Mr. Kiru noted that the order takes immediate effect. He called on parents to evacuate their wards as a result. This is coming hours after suspected gunmen kidnapped more than 300 schoolgirls in a government girls secondary school at Jangebe, Zamfara State. It would be recalled that earlier this month, some students and staff of Government Secondary School Kagara in Niger State, were abducted and yet to be released.
