By Femi Solaja with agency report Former Leicester Citywinger and Super Eagles Captain, Ahmed Musa, is set to return to Premier League as he will be arriving England this morning ahead of agreeing a deal with West Brom. Musa is a free agent after he was released from his contract at Saudi Arabia club Al Nassr last October. Uk’s Sportsmail reported that he has been invited by Sam Allardyce to bolster West Brom’s attacking options. The 28-year-old was initially expected to arrive England last week but there was a mix up over his travel arrangements from Nigeria. He’s due to arrive in the early hours of today to speedy up the process ahead of his formal unveiling later on Wednesday. As a free agent he can sign out of the window but West Brom want to be convinced of his condition and fitness before they agree a contract. Aside West Brom, Musa also has interest from Fulham and his former club CSKA Moscow. The 95-cap Nigerian international made 33 appearances in all competitions and scored just five goals for the Foxes between 2016 and 2018 after joining for a then-club record fee of £16.6million. He was loaned back to CSKA Moscow for the second half of the 2017/18 campaign. Musa was then sold to Al Nassr in January 2019 and played 62 times in all competitions before being released by the Saudi club. Boss Sam Allardyce insisted there could be more incomings before the transfer deadline but they would have to improve the squad for him to sanction a move. He said: “We have until 11pm, we will try between now and 11pm to try to find two more players who are available. “It’s not just the player, it’s also what finances are left. Time is running out but we have spent quite a considerable amount of our budget that was available. “If we can’t get the right player in then there’s no point getting a player in who won’t improve the first team,” concludes Big Sam last night.
