Deji Elumoye in Abuja President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has expressed dismay at the attack on Friday on Government Secondary School, Jangebe in Zamfara State where hundreds of school girls were abducted. Lawan, in a release issued on Friday by his Media Adviser, Ola Awoniyi, expressed sadness and outrage that the incident happened while efforts were still being made to rescue those abducted over a week ago at another secondary school in Kagara, Niger State. According to him, the recurrent attacks on schools and other acts of banditry call for intense soul searching on how the nation arrived at this sorry state and how to cage the monster of violent crimes in Nigeria. Lawan expressed his sympathy for the abducted schoolgirls and urged the authorities at all levels to work together to ensure their immediate rescue. He also reiterated his call on the state authorities to accord priority to securing schools and other locations now seen as soft targets by savage criminals. Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android
