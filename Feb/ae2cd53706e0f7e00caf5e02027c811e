The ranking senator, who is also a native of Yewaland, stressed that he had cried out about the deteriorating security situation in the country adding that urgent steps should be taken by the authorities to address the ugly trend the security situation. He, however, stressed that the body needed to come up with a workable report/solution to the government to abate the spate of arson and killing against the people of Yewaland. His words: “Let it be stated that as a representative of the people who swore to uphold the constitution and the laws of the land including the right to self defence, I will not hesitate to join my people in the defense of their rights to life, property and peaceful coexistence, especially at the seeming failure of duly constituted authorities to defend such fundamental rights against anyone or forces.”
