Come and see the picture of this ebony princess sent to me by my production czar, Ifeanyi. You will get goose pimples o. Those who know will know that I am about to take my next production to Uyo in Akwa Ibom, the land of my heritage. By the time you will be reading this I would be in Uyo enjoying rich afang which I will wash down with fresh palm wine. So I decided to use this damsel who shown like a thousand stars in Kunle Afolayan’s citadel for the lead role in my new play – Ibiom. My sister Elvina Ibru gave me the contact, and the voice came on the phone, and I fainted. I never wake up yet o. When I wake, I will write the story, for now make una leave me.
