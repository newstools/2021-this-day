Alex Enumah in Abuja The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad has urged for the unification of the African Judiciary if it must compete favourably with its counterpart across the globe.

While thanking them for the visit the CJN said the association should do everything it can to ensure African lawyers “compete favourably amongst the best of lawyers around the world in content and good character. “This is because African bench can’t be clean if its origin is filthy”. The statement noted that Justice Muhammad described African legal system “like a broken mirror reflecting different directions, especially the directions of various colonial homes of respective countries. Yet, Africans are the only people who in the past resolved disputes and issues through traditional institutions. “The association should work hard for the unification of African judiciary and mutual legal development”, he said.
