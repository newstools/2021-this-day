In a bid to curtail violence in women’s football in the country, the Nigeria Women Football League ((NWFL), yesterday announced a N1 million fine on one of its elite side, Ibom Angels Football Club of Uyo. Aside that another one year suspension was also imposed on one of the club’s fans who assaulted the Centre Referee of their Week 5 game played at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium Training Pitch in Uyo. The Chief Operating Officer of the NWFL, Modupe Shabi, said in a statement yesterday the match report of the clash between Ibom Angels and Rivers Angels clearly indicted the Akwa Ibom State-owned team. “ We are in receipt of the match reports from the Match Commissioner and the Centre Referee of the match number 33 between Ibom Angels FC and Rivers Angels. “The reports stated that one of Ibom Angels FC fans breached security and made contact with the centre referee by grabbing her short immediately after the blast of the final whistle before the prompt intervention of security personnel on duty at the match.” The COO noted that; “This action of one of Ibom Angels FC fans is a violation of article 26.1 of the rules book which is also capable of bringing the game into disrepute. “In view of the above, the Ibom Angels FC fan is hereby placed on suspension for a period of one year for the assault on the match official. “In line with article 26.1 and 27.1.3, Ibom Angels FC is also fined the sum of one million Naira only,” the letter concluded. The Chairperson of the Nigeria Women Football League, Aisha Falode, said from her base in Lagos, that, it is the belief of the league that this will serve as a deterrent to the club and a warning to all participating teams in the Premier League that there is zero tolerance for violence.
