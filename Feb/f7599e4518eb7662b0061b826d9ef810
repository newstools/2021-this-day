Vanessa Obioha Gospel singer and songwriter, Chinenye Nweke, aka Supernova recently released a love ballad. The sentimental song titled ‘Love Me’ is apt for the Valentine’s Day season and the singer assures that it will blow minds away. Also accompanying the romantic song is ‘My Year’, a song that she said would ‘uplift anybody facing difficulties.’ Having faced challenges in the course of her music career, including halting her musical pursuits, the beauty queen and native of Ebonyi state is turning new chapters in her life. And they include acting, activism and music. Other singles from her include ‘Hustle Go Pay’ and ‘Key’.
