Emma Okonji In order to support the federal government’s drive towards the National Identification Number (NIN) registration, MTN has introduced new initiatives that will increase capacity to provide enrolment services across its customer interaction touch points, which include rural locations. MTN said the initiatives would support a reliable and sustainable national identity management system for the country, which is a critical enabler that will deliver multiple benefits to the telecoms industry and the country as a whole, while supporting national economic planning and enhance security, governance and service delivery at all levels. At locations where enrolment services have been introduced, alongside its standard COVID-19 safety protocols, MTN has deployed a dynamic onsite appointment booking system designed to limit indoor crowding at its service centres and plans to launch an online version shortly. Following the approval of our NIN enrolment licence from the Nigerian Identity Management Commission (NIMC) in December, MTN Nigeria commenced enrolment for NIN at a limited number of its service centres across Nigeria. This forms part of a broader commitment to roll out thousands of enrolment devices across all geo-political zones as earlier stated. The Chief Customer Relations Officer for MTN Nigeria, Ugonwa Nwoye, said: “We seek the continued patience and understanding of our esteemed customers and the public as we continue scaling up capacity. “We are working closely with NIMC and the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy to expand the number of enrolment centres, and ensure that they provide an access point for as many Nigerians as possible. This involves close collaboration between other Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and NIMC to ensure certification and technical integration is seamless while offering maximum possible protection from COVID-19. “Ensuring that every Nigerian has access to a location where they can enrol in the NIN system, while simultaneously registering their SIM cards, is critical to the expansion and deepening of our digital economy, and we are committed to collaborating with the government in their efforts to achieve this.”
