The outgoing ADC, Abubakar, who was accompanied to the brief handing over ceremony by his wife and daughter, was nominated to attend a five-month Strategic and Defence Course at Santiago Chile from March 8 to 30 July 2021. The course is a prerequisite for his next promotion to the rank of Brigadier-General in the last quarter of 2021 and posting outside the shores of the country as a Defence Attachee/Adviser in keeping with the customs and tradition of recognising officers that served as Aide-De- Camp to the President and concluded tour of duty without any blemish. Abubakar, is the longest serving ADC to a civilian president having served in that position for almost six years, and the second-longest serving ADC in the history of Armed Forces of Nigeria after the late Colonel Walbe who served General Yakubu Gowon (rtd) for nine years. The 48 year-old ex-ADC, who had served in various Army units and formations within and outside Nigeria at different capacities also recommended his successor by nominating three seasoned and trustworthy Army Officers to President Buhari, and the Commander-in-Chief picked Dodo.
