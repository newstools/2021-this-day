By Adibe Emenyonu As the world marks the International Day for Women and Girls in Science, the wife of Edo State Governor, Mrs Betsy Obaseki, has reiterated the need to end gender-based violence, discrimination and subjugation against women and girls. Mrs. Obaseki, in a statement in Benin City, said the call became necessary as some women and girls have distinguished themselves as front liners in innovations like science and engineering. According to the governor’s wife, some women have also been in the forefront using their knowledge and skills in tackling various challenges across the world, most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. She therefore noted that the best way to celebrate the efforts of such women is to stop gender-based violence and all forms of discrimination and subjugation of women and girls in schools, work places and all forms of human endeavour. She said: “Some of our women and girls in science have been front liners in innovations and interventions in science, medicine, engineering etc. Our women have been in the forefront, using their knowledge and skills in tackling the myriads of challenges across the nation and the world, the most recent being the Covid-19 pandemic. “As we celebrate the International Day for Women and Girls in Science today, 11th of February, 2021 let us recognise their efforts and desist from gender-based violence and all forms of discrimination and subjugation of women and girls in schools, work places, homes and all areas of human endeavour. “Let us lend our voices in promoting Sustainable Development Goal 9; one of the Global Goals in which world leaders pledged to ‘build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation’. “Happy International Day of Women and Girls in Science.”
