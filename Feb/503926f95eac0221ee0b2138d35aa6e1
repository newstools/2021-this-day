By Michael Olugbode Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum has sacked the State Commissioner of Health, Dr. Salihu Kwayabura. The reason for his sack was unknown, though it had become a source of speculation among those in government. Some of those in government, that spoke to our correspondent anonymously, said that it was long overdue as the former commissioner’s allegiance to his principal was in doubt. Kwayabura, before his sack, was the Secretary of the high-powered committee on Covid-19, chaired by the Deputy Governor. According to the statement announcing his sack, the erstwhile commissioner is to be replaced in the interim by the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Professor Isa Hussani Marte, a professor of pharmacology. The statement issued on Tuesday by Special Adviser on Public Relations and Strategy, Malam Isa Gusau said: “Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum has relieved the state’s commissioner of health, Dr Salihu Kwayabura, of his position.” Gusau said the directive was part of necessary measures to reposition the ministry of health. He said: “Governor Zulum expresses gratitude to Dr Salihu Kwayabura for his immense contributions to the development of Borno’s public health sector in nearly two years of the current administration, and the years he had served under the previous administration. “The new man who will be standing in the interim, Professor Isa Hussani Marte, is a professor of pharmacology, a fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Science with specialty in cancer research.”
