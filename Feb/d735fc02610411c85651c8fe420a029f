Further to its quest to deliver seamless customer service to its customers, Investment One Financial Service Limited has come up with a new service which it christened ‘My Bank Statement.’ The new service allows customers to simply make request to the company to deliver their accounts statements wherever they are needed online-real-time. Chief Information Officer, Investment One Financial Services Ltd, Mr. Fisayo Fagbemi, disclosed that it was a value added service that would enhance customer satisfaction and boost service excellence which is one of the Company’s core values. “Due to the digital transformation taking place in the financial space, we envisaged our customers would require a service where they would like their statements sent directly on their behalf to embassies or requesting institutions, hence, we saw a need to provide this service proactively, before there was a surge in demand,” he explained. Fagbemi added that My Bank Statement service would help the Company swiftly send its customers’ statements on their behalf to the requesting organisation of their choice, noting that the channel is very secure. Speaking on the benefit of the service to customers, he said it would provide speed and convenience in meeting customers’ request. “Previously, they would send their request to us, then we sent the statements to them for onward transfer to the embassy or their preferred organisation but now once they send us a request, we generate their statement and send it directly to the requesting institution on their behalf.”
