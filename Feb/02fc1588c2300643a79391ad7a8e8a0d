The Abia State Police Command has said it killed four suspected hoodlums who allegedly attacked a police station in Abayi, Aba, in the Osisioma Ngwa Local Government Area of the state in the early hours of Tuesday. The police also claimed to have arrested eight members of the gang and recovered arms and ammunition. A statement issued yesterday by the Force spokesman, CP Frank Mba, said the hoodlums, numbering about 200 and armed with AK-47 rifles and machetes, invaded the station and set part of it ablaze with petrol bombs and other explosives. “Following the attack, ASP Vincent Gonze and Sgt Emmanuel Okoronkwo unfortunately paid the supreme price,” he said. He said the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, commiserated with the families and friends of the deceased officers.
