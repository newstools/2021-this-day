Southampton have requested referee Mike Dean does not officiate their upcoming fixtures and will appeal the red card shown to defender Jan Bednarek in their 9-0 loss to Manchester United. Fellow Premier League side Arsenal will appeal defender David Luiz’s sending off in Tuesday’s 2-1 defeat by Wolves. Saints also do not want Lee Mason, who was the fourth official at Old Trafford, to officiate their games. Mason was the referee in Saints’ recent controversial 1-0 loss to Aston Villa. Bednarek was the second player to be sent off for Ralph Hasenhuttl’s side when he brought down Anthony Martial and conceded a penalty in the 86th minute. Referee Dean initially only awarded a penalty to Manchester United but dismissed Bednarek after being instructed to watch replays of the incident on the pitchside monitor by video assistant referee Graham Scott.
