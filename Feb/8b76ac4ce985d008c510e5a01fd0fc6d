Worshippers at the popular Pentecostal church located on Oviri-Ogor road in Ughelli, scampered in different directions for safety, following the gunshots that disrupted the service. “The service abruptly came to an end at about 11.15 a.m. when gunshots rented the air inside the church premises. Worshippers ran in different directions to escape from the church auditorium. “It was when the gunmen escaped that some youths summoned up the courage to come out, only to discover the police officer in a pool of his blood and his rifle taken away,” an eye witness said. However, the Delta State acting Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Bright Edafe, said he was not aware of the incident at the time of filing this report. Meanwhile, the senior police officer in Ughelli confirmed the incident, disclosing that the policeman was confirmed dead at the Central Hospital Ughelli, where he was rushed for medical attention.

He was immediately rushed to Central Hospital Ughelli, where he was confirmed dead,” he said.
