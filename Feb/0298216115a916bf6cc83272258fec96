By Adibe Emenyonu Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State on Monday evening mourned the death of the former Minister of Information and Culture, Prince Tony Momoh. Obaseki, in statement in Benin, described the late Auchi prince as a politician, who spoke truth to power when it mattered the most. The Edo State governor celebrated the contributions of late Prince Momoh to the growth and development of Nigeria. “It is with a heavy heart that I received the news of the death of veteran journalist and former Minister of Information and Culture, Prince Tony Momoh”, the statement read. “Prince Momoh, though a great son of Edo State, was a total Nigerian. He was forthright, driven and spoke with candor. As a nationalist, he was unapologetic about the Nigerian project. His lasting legacy remains the enthronement of democratic values in Nigeria”, Obaseki eulogised. “A progressive and committed Nigerian, Prince Momoh’s wise counsel would be greatly missed especially as we navigate our current challenges as a nation. “On behalf of the government and people of Edo State, I commiserate with his family, friends and associates and wish that God grants them the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss,” Obaseki noted.
