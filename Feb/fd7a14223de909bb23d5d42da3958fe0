Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo The Osun State Government yesterday disclosed that in the past few days, the state has recorded five cases of the deadly B117 strain of the COVID-19, which was first reported in the United Kingdom. This is particularly worrisome as it was barely a week that the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 announced the discovery of the strain in Nigeria, and Osun State already has five cases. Considering the continued disregard for safety protocols in the state, the state government is extremely concerned about the days ahead. This new strain, according to report, spreads and kills faster. If it continues to grow, more citizens will become vulnerable and those with underlying ailments are more endangered. “We cannot continue to act like COVID-19 is not real. It is not just a sad reality but one that has changed the momentum with this deadlier strain. “Citizens are therefore enjoined to scale up their personal responsibility for safety by complying with all the non-pharmaceutical protocols outlined by the government to avoid tragic consequences,” the state government said.
