By Victor Ogunje A High Court in Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, has sentenced three persons to 14 and 10 years imprisonment for robbery and illegal possession of firearms. The convicted criminal are Okon Joseph, 23; Ebele Sunday, 19, and Daniel Simon, 20, who are to spend 10 years each for unlawful possession of firearms and 14 years for attempted robbery without option of fine . The sentences are to run concurrently by the convicts. In his judgement, Justice John Adeyeye said: “It is important to protect members of the society from these felons to serve as deterrent and keep the accused from circulation for some time. “Available evidence indicated that you are guilty of the offences preferred against you, and appropriate punitive actions must be meted out to sanitise our society.” According to the charge sheets, the act was committed on or about November 26, 2018, on Emure Ekiti highway where the accused persons were armed with two locally-made guns and conspired with intention of committing armed robbery, contrary to sections 6(b), 2 and 3(1) of the robbery and firearms (special provision Act) Cap R11, laws of the federation of Nigeria, 2004. One of the local security operatives, who testified before the court, said they were arrested on Emure/Eporo road after they received distress call from the villagers in the area. To prove his case, the prosecutor, O. M Ajumobi, called four witnesses, while two locally-made pistols, three live cartridges, Indian hemps, tramadol tablets, statements of the accused among others were tendered as exhibits. The accused spoke in their defence through their counsel, Chris Omokhafe, and called no witness.
