A priest of the Nsukka Catholic Diocese in Enugu State, Reverend Father Anthony Ali, has dragged his brother, Amobi Ali, to Enugu-Ezike Chief Magistrates’ court for allegedly assaulting and threatening him and their father, John Ali. In a charge sheet, MIE/6C/2021, the plaintiffs, Fr. Ali and his father had in a three-count alleged that the defendant on February 2, 2021, at Umuopu Community, Enugu-Ezike, Igbo-Eze North, assaulted and threatened their life. When the case was called yesterday, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges after they were read to him. The defendant’s counsel, Mr. Leonard Ekeh, prayed the court to admit his client to bail. The Magistrate, Mr. Sylvester Eze, admitted the defendant to N100,000 bail with one surety in like sum. Eze who advised the family to go home and make peace, adjourned the case to March 10 for hearing, should the peace talk fail.Briefing journalists after the court session, Eke said it was a family matter that should be resolved at home. Eke, giving insight on the matter, said that the defendant was beaten, arrested and arraigned because he advised his father, John and brother Fr. Ani to stop struggling over a piece land that does not belong to them but Dr. Ejikeme Odumegwu. “I stood in for Amobi Ali who was accused of beating his father and his brother who is a Rev Fr. The counts were three which borders on assault and threat to life. It’s a family domestic issue which should be settled at home considering the presence of a Catholic priest. “My own observations and finding on the cause of the matter was that Amobi advised his brother, Fr Anthony and his father John to hands off the land they are struggling over which belongs to Dr, Ejikeme Odumegwu and they descended on him,” he alleged.
