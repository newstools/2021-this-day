By Hammed Shittu Twenty members of a youth group in the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara State under the aegis of the Concerned APC Youth Stakeholders have instituted a court action restraining the chairman of the party’s registration exercise, Senator John Danboi, and state Chairman of the party, Abdulahi Samari, from going ahead to organise the exercise scheduled for February 9, 2021. Speaking with journalists in Ilorin yesterday, spokesperson of the group, John Adegboyega, said the exercise would lead to chaos and threat to the security of the state, “known to be a state of harmony, if embarked upon.” In a suit number UACG/CV/20/2021, filed in an Upper Area Court of the state in the Ganmo judicial division yesterday, the group averred that the registration exercise planned for February 9, 2021, by the APC is singlehandedly planned by only Fagbemi tendency, excluding three other tendencies that make up the party. “The plaintiffs averred that in state chapter of the APC, there are four tendencies which are Lai Mohammed Tendency; Akogun Tendency; Fagbemi Tendency, and Gbemisola Saraki Tendency,” the group said. The APC group also alleged that on February 3, 2021, the defendants, with the assistance of suspected hoodlums, prevented the plaintiffs and their supporters from entering the venue of the meeting of the APC stakeholders meeting in Ilorin. “The plaintiffs stated further that if the re-registration exercise proceeds as planned by the defendants, most of the members of the association will be disenfranchised, including the plaintiffs, which will amount to violation of their fundamental human rights to freedom of association,” it added. The APC youth group, which alleged that members were being intimidated and harassed by security operatives in the state, said Kwara Central senatorial youth leader, Issa Abubakar Alfulani, was reportedly suspended by the party through a letter that bore no signature or name yesterday.
