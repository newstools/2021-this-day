Mr Muhammad Sunusi Kiru who disclosed this in a short audio message announced on radio stations in the state, said the closure became necessary due to the rising number of abduction of school children in neighboring states. The closed schools are located in Ajingi, Sumaila, Jogana, Kafin Maiyaki and Gaya, among others.
