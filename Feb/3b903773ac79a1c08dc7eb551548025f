The certainty of her manner of speaking and fact-wise content of her policy expositions have combined to make her one of the most sought after economists in the world. Evident in the fact, too, she sits on the boards of several corporations and offers advisory and management ideas to organizations. Why is she in the news, this time?
All things being equal — as her fellow economists usually say on matters of demand and supply —she will this February 2021 make history, again. She is on track to become the first person of African heritage and the first woman to hold the top position of Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The position opened with the sudden, early exit of the man who was there; he left since August 2020. Then the notorious administration of former American President Donald Trump blocked her from moving into the position after she was nominated by the Nigerian government. Then, last Friday, her major opponent for the position dropped out of running. She got the critical nod of the American government now led by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. In a sunny signal toward the nomination, an official of the U.S government wrote that “The United States takes note of today’s decision by the Republic of Korea’s Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee to withdraw her candidacy for Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The Biden-Harris administration is pleased to express its strong support for the candidacy of Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the next Director General of the WTO”.
Long before this support, some of the WTO key members/blocs, such as China, the European Union, the African Union, Japan and Australia had indicated their support of Okonjo-Iweala. Also, she has a strong network of influential friends — largely amassed during her 25 years at the World Bank. Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala whom I met in Maryland during the event by her alma mater Queens Girls Secondary School Enugu, almost 10 years ago — has been a major reference point for inspiration and role model for millions of women. Especially, while she was the Finance Minister and the Coordinating Minister of the Economy in Nigeria.
She was Minister of Finance May 19, 2015, under Goodluck Jonathan. July 2003 – June 21, 2006, under Obasanjo. She was appointed into a new position, Coordinating Minister for the Economy, August 17, 2011 – May 29, 2015 Since January 2016, she was appointed the Chair-elect of the Board of Gavi which is involved in provide pandemic virus solutions. Bob Zoellick, World Bank’s ex-president, is one of the heavyweight friends of the public finance heavyweight. He wrote a memo to World Bank employees on July 8, 2011, where he commended her for, among other things, pushing African economies to greater reliance on open free-market positions. He noted that “Along with her oversight of the bank’s work in Africa, South Asia, Europe, and Central Asia, and Human Resources, Ngozi has played a pivotal role in overseeing the Bank’s work to help countries hurt by high and volatile food prices…. with Ngozi’s leadership, we put together a food crisis response fund to allow for fast assistance to countries in need. It has helped more than 40 million people in 44 countries.” Two of her most recent books are ‘Fighting Corruption is Dangerous : The Story Behind the Headlines – A Frontline Account from Nigeria’s former Finance Minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, of How to Fight Corruption and Lessons Learned for Governance and Development’ — published by MIT Press, (2018) and ‘Reforming the Unreformable: Lessons from Nigeria’ (First MIT Press paperback ed. (2012) Hopefully, she will begin work at the WTO next week to help create a fairer trade relations between African countries and other parts of the world. At another level, it will be a new heights of inspiration for many girls. Remember that one of the most influential women of the 20th century Hillary Clinton did say regarding an entirely different issue. ”To all the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful, and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.” Okonjo-Iweala has been listed as one of the 50 Greatest World Leaders by Fortune magazine in 2015; and has been featured as one of 100 of the World’s Leaders.
