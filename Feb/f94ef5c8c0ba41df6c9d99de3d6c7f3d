By Ibrahim Shuaibu Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano state has relieved his Special Adviser on Media, Salihu Tanko Yakasai, of his appointment over his continued unguarded comments and utterances which are deemed contrary to the stand of the All Progressive Congress (APC) government which he is serving. The state commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, who conveyed the governor’s directive in a statement made available to THISDAY in Kano on Saturday, said the sack was with immediate effect. He said the aide had failed to differentiate between personal opinion and official stand on matters of public concern and therefore cannot be allowed to continue to serve in a government he did not believe. The governor also warned political appointees and public servants to guard against making statements capable of drawing superfluous controversy. The statement reaffirmed the commitment of Governor Ganduje to the policies and programmes of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. Recall that Mr Salihu Tanko-Yakasai, son of elder statesman, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, was arrested by security operatives Friday over his comments on Buhari and APC. Alhaji Tanko Yakasai confirmed the arrest of his son to reporters in a telephone interview in Kano on Saturday and said his son was arrested on Friday on his way to a barber’s shop in the city. “Yes, Salihu has been with the security operatives since yesterday (Friday). He was arrested on his way to a barbing saloon. But I cannot confirm to you whether he is here in Kano or somewhere else,” he said. Sources close to Mr Salihu Tanko informed our Correspondent that he was taken to Abuja by the security operatives.
