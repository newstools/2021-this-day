Rebecca Ejifoma The South-east chapter of the Atiku Support Organisation (ASO) has commiserated with the Anambra State Government, Ohanaeze, and Aka Ikenga following the death of former President of Aka Ikenga, Oscar Onwudiwe, to COVID-19. In a statement signed by the South-east Zonal Coordinator, Alozie Alozie, the group prayed to God to grant his family the fortitude to bear the loss. While eulogising the late icon, Alozie described Onwudiwe as a man of truth and principles, who stood up for the Igbo people and Nigerians. “Nigerians, not just the Igbo people, have lost a rare gem. He was a man who was ready to give his life for the truth. “It is so bad that we lost such a great man to COVID-19,” Alozie added, as he further called on Nigerians to adhere to the rules of social distancing and mask wearing in order to curb the spread of the virus. The zonal coordinator further enjoined the public on adhering to safety precautions, adding that coronavirus is real, and as such, “it is the duty of every Nigerian to be careful and adhere to the guidelines set by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).”
