It is not a surprise that the virtue of love, humility and care would run through in honour of Senator Douye Diri to commemorate one year in office. These are some of his intrinsic qualities, the defining features of his existence. It is his right to be so described that way. As a commissioner, who works closely with the governor, I am pleased to be associated with the Prosperity vision led by Douye Diri. The current stability, repositioning of the state as an ideal national and international tourist choice for economic development in this one year is priceless. I am more delighted to align with Diri’s policies aimed at diversifying the state economy and placing it on the path of sustainable growth and development. The state is gratified with the resolute development strides in ensuring that the state harnesses all tourism potential in the eight local govt areas and to show them to the world. The good people of Bayelsa State recognizes Diri’s enthusiasm to ensure that the Bayelsa State Council for Art and Culture maintained the zenith and premium position in the 31st National Festival of Arts and Culture (NAFEST) held in Jos, Plateau State, November 2020. Bayelsans acknowledges Diri’s resolve in preserving and promoting the Ijaw heritage for socio-economic development of the state. And Bayelsa State is increasingly becoming a construction hub. Within one year, there is no doubt Diri is prepared to attract investors and tourist into key sectors to fulfil the aspirations and yearnings of every Bayelsan. It is my prayer that God grant the governor more grace to fulfil purpose and take the good people of Bayelsa to their place of prosperity.
–Dr. Oti Orugbani, Commissioner for Tourism, Bayelsa State
