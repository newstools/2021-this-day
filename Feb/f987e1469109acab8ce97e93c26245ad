The South-south geopolitical zone has emerged champion at the National U-17 Cricket Championship, sponsored by PwC Nigeria. The two-week tournament, which was organised by the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF), ended on February 7, 2021, with the South-south team emerging as the victor in a thrilling final with their North-west peers. The win meant that South-south did the double, having won the girls’ final a week earlier. During the awards ceremony, Regional Senior Partner PwC Nigeria, Mr. Uyi Akpata, appreciated efforts of the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Mr. Sunday Dare, towards the development of cricket in Nigeria, and for helping to ensure that the organisers of the competition followed COVID-19 protocols. Commenting on the championship, Akpata noted that he was impressed by the performance of the youths. “The young cricketers had put in an exceptional performance,” he said, while noting that all the participating zones in both the girls’ and boys’ final should be proud of their performance. The President of the Nigeria Cricket Federation, Prof. Adam Yahaya Ukwenya, noted that the National U-17 Cricket Championship represented the final development of young cricketers in Nigeria.
