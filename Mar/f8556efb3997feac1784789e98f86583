The Lagos State branch of the Government College Ughelli Old Boys Association, has expressed shock over the death of Rear Admiral Joe Aikhomu (rtd), who until his passing, was an active member of the association. In a statement issued yesterday by Mr. Sam Omatseye, the association noted that the late naval officer enrolled as an entry student at the school in 1971. The statement noted that in school, the late Aikhomu was an all-rounder. It also described the late officer as a good sportsman and a member of the School’s elite Cadet unit, adding that his involvement in the Cadet unit laid the foundation for his long successful military career which spanned over 30 years. “As we mourn the passing of Rear Admiral Joe Aikhomu (rtd), we pray for the repose of his soul and for God Almighty to comfort members of his beloved family. “He will be sorely missed by the executive and members of the branch. “Admiral, Adieu as you rest on. We wish you rest in the bosom of the Lord,” the statement explained.
