Nume Ekeghe Guaranty Trust Bank plc (GTBank) in celebration of the International Women’s Day (IWD21) has stated that it is providing 1000 self-employed women with BetaHealth for a year, at no cost. The bank has therefore called on people and organisations to #choosetochallenge for a better world for women. The initiative tagged #GiveHerBetaHealth, was launched to draw attention to the need for universal essential healthcare coverage, especially for women in the informal sector. Launched in 2020, BetaHealth is a low-cost healthcare package that provides coverage for essential health services such as malaria treatments, pre and postnatal care, accidents and medical emergencies as well as life insurance, all at a subscription fee of N500 per month. Offered through more than 1000 hospitals and pharmacies nationwide, BetaHealth also provides a telemedicine service that allows the user to speak with a Doctor over the phone anytime, anywhere. With the #GiveHerBetaHealth campaign, the bank is calling on the general public to nominate 1000 women who will be given free BetaHealth coverage for a year. #GiveHerBetaHealth is the latest in a long line of GTBank initiatives that, “reflects the bank’s commitment to extending access to critical services for everyone, irrespective of their social or economic background. “The campaign focuses on empowering self-employed women in the informal sector, many of who have limited or no access to financial services and health insurance. “With this campaign, the bank is putting a spotlight on the need for universal access to essential healthcare services that is affordable for every working Nigerian, and accessible across the country,” it added.
