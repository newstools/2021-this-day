Robert Lewandowski’s hat-trick outdid Erling Braut Haaland’s early double as Bayern Munich came from behind to beat Dortmund in a Der Klassiker thriller. Haaland drove Dortmund ahead from 20 yards after just 74 seconds and then turned home Thorgan Hazard’s cut-back. But Lewandowski steered in Leroy Sane’s cross and levelled from the spot after Mahmoud Dahoud fouled Kingsley Coman. Leon Goretzka drilled Bayern ahead late on before Lewandowski’s third confirmed a return to the top of the Bundesliga.
