By Rebecca Ejifoma The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, Tuesday, inspected the Lagos State storage facility at Ikeja where the COVID-19 vaccines are kept for adequate safety. The CP, who was received by the State Immunisation Officer, Mrs. Bola Orefejo, and her team, harped on the safety and sensitivity of the vaccines. He further cautioned that unauthorised staff or individuals were prohibited from the premises of the cold store. Odumosu, however, directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Operations, Ahmed Kontangora, to deploy adequate police personnel to the facility. He also ordered the Area Commander, Area F, ACP Ali Zongo, and Divisional Police Officer, Ikeja, CSP Taiwo Oyewale, to supervise the men detailed to provide security for the staff and the vaccines accordingly. To further ensure proper security, the CP directed that the entire surroundings of the storage facility be cordoned off while the area should be made free of intruders.
