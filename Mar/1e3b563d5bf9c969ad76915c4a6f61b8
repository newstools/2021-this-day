By Deji Elumoye The federal government has declared Zamfara state airspace as a no-fly-zone to airlines and other users as a result of the rising level of insecurity in the state.
This was one of the highlights of Tuesday’s meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) held at the State House Abuja with President Muhammadu Buhari presiding. National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Monguno (rtd), told reporters after the meeting that President Muhammadu Buhari also approved, based on recommendation, the imposition and enforcement of a ban on all mining activities in Zamfara State with immediate effect, until further notice. According to him, the President has directed the Minister of Defence and the National Security Adviser (NSA) to deploy massive military and intelligence assets to restore normalcy to that part of the country.

We’ve had a lot of reports coming in; collusion with people from all walks of life”. Details later…
