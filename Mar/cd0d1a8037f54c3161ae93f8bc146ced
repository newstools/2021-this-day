Dike Onwuamaeze Union Bank of Nigeria Plc (UBN) has launched the M36 digital investment platform that would offer a wide range of investment opportunities to investors through a self-service app. The M36 also offers loans, personal travel allowance, will and trust services and many more essential products under its life essentials menu. It was also designed to deliver a wide range of investment options not readily available on self-service digital platforms like foreign currency transactions, commercial papers, local and foreign denominated bonds, treasury bills and other fixed income products. The Head, Treasury at the UBN, Mr. Chuka Emerole, said: “The M36 eliminates the traditional barriers to investing and offers investors direct access to financial instruments that would usually require the service of an investment or relationship manager. “We’ve designed M36 to ensure simplicity in the onboarding and investing process while also empowering the customer to make sound investment choices based on their financial objectives. We worked with key partners to deliver both the experience and products on M36 and are confident that we have launched a superior product in today’s marketplace.” Emerole said with its 24-hour concierge service, the M36 users could access round the clock support from investment advisors as they actively manage their portfolios. The bank said the M36 was a timely financial product meant to keep abreast with the rapidly evolving environment and changing consumer behavior that is fueled by technology and growing access to information. The M36 is also part of the UBN’s strategic focus on delivering superior customer solutions by leveraging technology and innovation. The bank partnered with several asset management companies to deliver the broad range of investment products on the M36 platform.
