Despite the decision of the Court of Appeal that parties in the Alafin of Afin-Akoko Obaship tussle should maintain status quo, the Ondo State Government and the Kingmakers are said to be going ahead to install an Alafin of Afin-Akoko despite the initiation of contempt proceeding against them. The legal tussle to determine who ascends the revered throne has been on since 2013. The Court of Appeal sitting at Akure, Ondo State capital, had on November 5, 2020 ordered that parties to the Appeal No:CA/AK/208/2017 between Meshack Odeja (Appeallant) & Ohers V Chief Zacheaus Adewunmi & Others (Respondents), to maintain status quo pending the determination of the appeal. The three-man Appeal Court panel was headed by Justice OF Omoleye, with Justice RM Abdullahi and Justice PA Mahmoud, as members. The Ode Gbangba family, that is, the appellants appealed against the judgment of the Ondo State High Court and the Court of Appeal ordered parties to maintain status quo pending the determination of the appeal. The Respondents are yet to file their briefs despite being in receipt of the Appellantsâ€™ brief. However, the Government of Ondo State and Kingmakers are going ahead to install an Alafin of Afin-Akoko despite the initiation of contempt proceeding against them.
