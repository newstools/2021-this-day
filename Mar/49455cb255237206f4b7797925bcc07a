By James Sowole The Ondo State chapter of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders’ Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has recommended that herders should seek modern alternatives to open grazing, and urged the government to make provision for ranches to end the frequent clashes between herders and farmers. Speaking yesterday in Akure, Ondo State capital, during a public hearing on a bill to regulate grazing of livestock and provide for the establishment of ranches, among other related issues, the Chairman of the association in the state, Alhaji Bello Garba, said the association would support any peaceful move to address the issue. He argued that farmers and herders must carry out their respective activities without clashing. He disclosed that his association has also appealed to the state government to register Fulani men in all the LGAs of the state. Also speaking, the Assistant Secretary of the association, Mr. Ibrahim Abdul-Rahman, stated that open grazing had become obsolete and needed to be banned. Abdul-Rahman asked all stakeholders to embrace modern cattle rearing techniques, saying farmers and herders must allow peace to reign considering the importance of both parties to the nation’s growth. In his opening speech, the Speaker of Ondo State House of Assembly, Hon. Bamidele Oloyelogun, said it was aimed at enhancing peaceful coexistence in the state. Oloyelogun added that if similar moves had been made in the past, it would have been a different story today. “It is for peace to reign in our state. This record will go a long way, having effects even on the children yet unborn,” Oloyelogun said. “Your memoranda and suggestions will be welcome. Please, feel free to air your views and bare your minds, but we must be objective and constructive.”
