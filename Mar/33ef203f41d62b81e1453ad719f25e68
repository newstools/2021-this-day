Segun James In fulfilment of his pledge to further support indigent Lagos State residents, Senator Adetokunbo Abiru has fulfilled his promise of financial support to the second batch of 1,200 vulnerable residents of the Lagos East Senatorial District.

The second batch is also to all the wards and council areas in the district.

“We shall continuously look out and champion policies and legislative agenda that will be of benefit to the greatest number of our people”, the Senator assured. Meanwhile, members of the Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board, (LASUBEB) paid a courtesy visit to Senator Abiru at his Constituency office in Ikorodu to seek his support and interventions for public schools in the district.
Following the request for Covid 19 equipment support, a truck-load of 150,000 facemasks was moved to the agency’s headquarters in Maryland, Lagos for onward distribution to pupils and teachers in the Lagos East Senatorial District.
