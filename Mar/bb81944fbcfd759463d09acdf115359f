Goddy Egene The stock market declined further last week as investors ignored the corporate results and dividends being declared by companies.
The market, which lost N1.364 trillion in month of February, shed N245 billion last week while the benchmark index declined by 1.18 per cent to close at 39,331.61. The continuing bear run is persisting despite the inflow of corporate results by companies. It was expected that the declaration of dividends by companies would stop the bears. Analysts at Cordros Securities had said they expected the NSE floor to be flooded with corporate earnings as more companies publish their audited FY 2020 numbers, accompanied by dividend declarations.
“We believe this should provide respite for market performance. However, we expect intermittent profit-taking activities to continue due to lingering concerns about yield elevation in the FI market. As a result, we think the local bourse will likely exhibit a zig-zag pattern. “Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings,” analysts had said.

The Chief Executive Officer of the NSE, Mr. Oscar Onyema, recently expressed optimism that the market would record another impressive performance in 2021, saying the exchange would consolidate on the benefits of demutualisation.
Speaking during the virtual presentation of the 2020 market recap and 2021outlook, Onyema said the year has started on a positive note as the ASI has already returned 1.72 per cent after nine trading sessions.
“We expect the marginal reopening of businesses, normalisation of the economy and revenue-diversification drive of the Nigerian government to elicit positive sentiments throughout the year,” he added. According to him, as the NSE transitions to a demutualised exchange group, new appointments were recently announced, which he said would support the NSE’s vision to be Africa’s preferred exchange hub.
“We look forward to consolidating on the benefits of demutualisation in the coming year. We intend to aggressively pursue cutting-edge products and services, access new markets and deliver better value to our valued stakeholders,” Onyema said.
