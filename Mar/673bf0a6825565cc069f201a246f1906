The Ekiti State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on Governor Kayode Fayemi not to use the state’s funds for the establishment of cattle ranches for herdsmen. The opposition party was reacting to the proposed plan by the government to set up ranches as a viable solution to stem the increasing waves of clashes between farmers and herdsmen in the state. In a statement yesterday by the State Publicity Secretary, Raphael Adeyanju, PDP said though ranching for herdsmen was imperative but government should not use public funds for the creation. It described cattle breeding as a private business being undertaken by everyone irrespective of ethnic affinity, adding that interested herdsmen should establish ranches on their own since open-grazing was no longer fashionable in the 21st century. The party vowed to resist with available constitutional means any attempt by the governor to play politics with the destiny of Ekiti people because of his rumoured 2023 presidential ambition. The statement reads,” The attention of Ekiti Chapter of the PDP has been drawn to the plan of the Fayemi’s government to create ranches for herders in Ekiti State. We can describe this as a welcome development as long as no government fund is expended on a private business. “We in the PDP regard cow rearing as lucrative business. Apart the Fulani’s, many indigenes of Ekiti also engage in the business, they should be encouraged to engage in modern ranching. “We are however opposed to Fayemis attempt to play politics with Ekiti destiny because of his inordinate ambition. He has no right to cede any portion of Ekiti to appease some troublesome elements of the society,” it added.
