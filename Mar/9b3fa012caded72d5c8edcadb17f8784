By Onyebuchi Ezigbo The Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, has stated that President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has performed better in infrastructural development than the administration. Ngige also said that Buhari deserved accolade for prioritising infrastructural development even with the prevailing lean national resources. He said that even with less resources compared to the Jonathan’s era, the well-considered development agenda of the Buhari administration that priotised infrastructures has led to development springing up in every part of the country more than ever. “This government is battling lean budget as a consequence of reasons we all are familiar with, prime among which is dwindling national resources. Yet, Buhari is giving Nigerians more critical infrastructures than his predecessor that enjoyed abundance,” Ngige said. Ngige also thanked the Minister of Transport, Mr. Chibuike Amaechi, for the inclusion of the South-East in the project with spurs in Awka and Abakiliki, pulling a loud laughter from the audience as he threw a joke: “The transport minister knows his wife is our sister from Anambra and the dangers of leaving out his in-laws might see us asking her to come home.”
