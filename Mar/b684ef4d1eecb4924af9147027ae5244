Contrary to a narrative making the rounds that respected billionaire businessman, Chief Leemon Ikpea, unilaterally evicted his estranged wife, Agnes, from their home in Lagos, members of the Ikpea family, friends and associates have explained that Ikpea appropriately, respectfully sought and obtained necessary procedures to divorce his estranged wife. Some highly placed family members , friends and associates therefore enjoined members of the public to respect the well-thought out decision of the distinguished billionaire businessman and esteemed Adolor of Ewatto in Esan, Edo State, to seek legal divorce from his wife, Agnes. The family members, friends and associates who craved anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter, said Ikpea is a dignified, respected and accomplished family man who has raised all six children, born by Agnes for him as their father, to the most highly accomplished career, professional and business heights in life. According to family members, the diligent, highly respected father and accomplished businessman has done what every distinguished father would offer for his children and family members. The family members pleaded with Agnes to give peace a chance, and retrace her steps by desisting from attempting to drag the businessman into the media terrain for unwarranted reasons. Family members also urged the public to listen to the other side of the narrative and “respect the wishes and decision of our father and brother to pursue a permanent separation and divorce from his estranged wife, Agnes.” According to the family, for an industrialist, eminent family man father, top-notch philanthropist, a humanist and a resected Christian who has married his now estranged wife for almost four decades and raised children that have been trained to the highest levels of educational accomplishments and have had these children fully established with the best life can offer, including excellent educational attainments, professional accomplishments, decent houses and businesses, to seek legal divorce away from his now estranged wife, Agnes must be based on well-founded, grounded and tough personal decision, which should be respected by all.
