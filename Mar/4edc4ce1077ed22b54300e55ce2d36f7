By Udora Orizu The House of Representatives, Wednesday decried the growing number of abandoned projects in the country, describing it as alarming and inimical to growth and development. The lower chamber also bemoaned the duplication of projects, saying such are always observed in the national budget. The Chairman, Ad-hoc Committee investigating executed, funded and repeated capital projects in the Appropriation Acts, Hon. Makki Abubakar made the observation during a meeting of the panel. Abubakar who put the blame on some Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government, queried why they should embark on white elephant projects to waste tax payers money. He however said that the Committee after its meeting would be engaging the services of some consultants to help in tracking and aggregating unexecuted projects with a view to completing them. Some members of the committee, who also decried the situation, said that reports from MDAs did not always reflect the realities on the ground. They therefore resolved to ensure that the projects were identified and completed.
