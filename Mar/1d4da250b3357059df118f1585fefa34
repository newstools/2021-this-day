By Obinna Chima The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has described as false media reports that it was preparing to bar foreign portfolio investors from participating in its Open Market Operations (OMO) auction. A top official of the central bank who disclosed this on Wednesday, said the central bank would continue to take steps to encourage inflow of foreign exchange as it seeks to strengthen the naira exchange rate.

OMO is a liquidity management tool of the central bank. More details laterâ€¦
