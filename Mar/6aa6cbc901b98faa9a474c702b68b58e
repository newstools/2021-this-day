Since leaving Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr in October last year, Musa has not played competitive game for five months. The Super Eagles Coach was forced to clarify and defend Musa’s non-playing role as the 24th player. “It’s important to clarify that Musa is not in the competitive list of 23 players for our game against Benin and Lesotho,” Rohr told BBC Sport Africa on Wednesday. “We’ve invited Musa as the captain by making him the 24th player, but he is not as part of the 23 on the list that will play our two matches. “What is important now is to focus on the games ahead and not to be distracted by anything else. We hope for all our players to be fit and travel down safely for the matches.” However Saudi Arabia-based striker Odion Ighalo is not included in the squad as he continues to consider a request from Rohr to come out of international retirement.

Three-time continental champions Nigeria currently top Group L on eight points, one ahead of Benin while Sierra Leone have three points and Lesotho two
