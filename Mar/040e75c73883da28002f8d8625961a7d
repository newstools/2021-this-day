By Francis Sardauna The Katsina State Chapter of the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) has used celebration of the International Women’s Day to admonished government at all levels to ensure that women are adequately represented in positions of power by implementing gender-balanced appointments. The association also urged women to challenge inequality, injustice and all forms of abuse and non-inclusiveness being suffered by women and children, emphasising that women should always make a difference wherever they find themselves. The State NAWOJ Chairperson, Ms. Hannatu Mohammed, in a statement issued yesterday, tasked government to provide more gender-sensitive empowerment programmes in order to boost self-reliance amongst women in the country. Mohammed said: “As a union that seeks to improve the social wellbeing of women, the Katsina State Council of the NOWAJ will continue to mobilise and challenge the patriarchal status quo and influence social norms to facilitate the growth of women visionaries. “On this note, the state council of NAWOJ amplifies the voices of its fearless members who represent the enormous potentials of women to call on all stakeholders to rededicate and reposition themselves in improving the quality-of-life of women.”
