Charles Ajunwa As part of efforts to strengthen cultural ties between South Korea and Nigeria, the two countries have agreed to further explore and consolidate on the mutual cultural benefits, which started in 2010. The Director General, National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), Otunba Segun Runsewe, disclosed this when the Ambassador of the Republic of South Korea, His Excellency, Kim Young Chae, paid him a courtesy visit in his office in Abuja.
Runsewe noted that Nigeria has benefited a lot from the mutual relationship with South Korea in areas of education, poverty eradication, trade and many more. According to him, the trade between the two countries as at 2011, was well over $3 million dollars.
The NCAC boss also informed the South Korean Ambassador on the forthcoming programme of NCAC called the International Arts and Crafts Expo (INAC) and requested for the participation of South Korea. He also sought partnership with the Republic of South Korea in organising a joint exhibition in Nigeria and in South Korea noting that this will be very rewarding to both countries. On capacity building, Runsewe told the South Korean Ambassador to Nigeria that the need for capacity building for NCAC staff on seminars, workshops and conferences on arts and culture, festivals, exchange visits and exhibitions between South Korea and NCAC cannot be over emphasised. In his response, the ambassador of South Korea, Kim Young Chae said the embassy of South Korea will be interested in a joint programme for school children and other cultural programmes that will make Koreans to understand Nigerians better. He proposed a joint food festival as well as Arts and Crafts exhibition later in the year. The ambassador said that the Korean cultural centre would soon be upgraded so that NCAC could use it to project Nigerian films and programmes.
He promised to work with NCAC to achieve a sustainable mutual understanding between South Korea and Nigeria.
