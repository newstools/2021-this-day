By Michael Olugbode The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has raised the alarm that 10 million additional child marriages may occur before the end of the decade, threatening years of progress in reducing the practice. An analysis released by the UN agency on International Women’s Day (IWD) on Monday titled: “COVID-19: A threat to progress against child marriage,” warned that school closures, economic stress, service disruptions, pregnancy and parental deaths due to the pandemic are putting the most vulnerable girls at increased risk of child marriage. It said: “Even before the COVID-19 outbreak, 100 million girls were at risk of child marriage in the next decade, despite significant reductions in several countries in recent years. In the last 10 years, the proportion of young women globally who were married as children had decreased by 15 per cent, from nearly 1 in 4 to 1 in 5, the equivalent of some 25 million marriages averted, a gain that is now under threat.” The statement released on Monday by UNICEF, quoted UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore to have said: “COVID-19 has made an already difficult situation for millions of girls even worse. Shuttered schools, isolation from friends and support networks, and rising poverty have added fuel to a fire the world was already struggling to put out. But we can and we must extinguish child marriage. “International Women’s Day is a key moment to remind ourselves of what these girls have to lose if we do not act urgently – their education, their health, and their futures.” The statement lamented that girls who marry in childhood face immediate and lifelong consequences, adding that they are more likely to experience domestic violence and less likely to remain in school. It said child marriage increases the risk of early and unplanned pregnancy, in turn increasing the risk of maternal complications and mortality, adding that the practice can also isolate girls from family and friends and exclude them from participating in their communities, taking a heavy toll on their mental health and well-being. It lamented that COVID-19 was profoundly affecting the lives of girls, as pandemic-related travel restrictions and physical distancing make it difficult for girls to access the health care, social services and community support that protect them from child marriage, unwanted pregnancy and gender-based violence. It said: “As schools remain closed, girls are more likely to drop out of education and not return. Job losses and increased economic insecurity may also force families to marry their daughters to ease financial burdens.” It recalled that worldwide, an estimated 650 million girls and women alive today were married in childhood, with about half of those occurring in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India and Nigeria, insisting that to off-set the impacts of COVID-19 and end the practice by 2030 – the target set out in the Sustainable Development Goals – progress must be significantly accelerated. The statement quoted Fore to have said: “One year into the pandemic, immediate action is needed to mitigate the toll on girls and their families. “By reopening schools, implementing effective laws and policies, ensuring access to health and social services – including sexual and reproductive health services – and providing comprehensive social protection measures for families, we can significantly reduce a girl’s risk of having her childhood stolen through child marriage.”
