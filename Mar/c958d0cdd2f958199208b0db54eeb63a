By Adibe Emenyonu The Edo State Government Wednesday denied the claim by the Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports Development that the renovation of the gymnasium and multipurpose hall at Etete area in Benin City was carried out by the apex sports authorities. Edo State Deputy Governor, Mr. Philip Shaibu, flayed the claim when he led officials of the state government on inspection of the gymnasium and multipurpose hall. He expressed dismay over the erection of a signpost at the site indicating that the project was undertaken by the Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports Development. Shaibu declared that the renovation of the sports edifice was completed by the Edo State Government in preparation for the hosting of the 2020 National Sports Festival, noting that the contractor will be invited to explain the rationale behind erecting the sign post at the project site. The deputy governor ordered the immediate removal of the sign post and arrest of any person connected with the said renovation. On the hosting of the National Sports Festival, Shaibu assured that the Edo State Government is ready for the sports fiesta, noting however, that it all depends on when the Federal Government is ready to fulfil its side of the bargain.
