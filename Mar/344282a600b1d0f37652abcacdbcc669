Ikpeazu urged political leaders to serve as mentors to the younger generation, while holding political offices. The governor who was Special Guest at the event, said leaders must in the course of leading, mentor youths who were the future leaders of the country. “For us leaders, it is a calling. If you are called to lead, you are also called to be a mentor to the young ones and what you say, how you carry yourself and the things you say and the times you say them, speak a lot about how serious you are as a person. “I share in the joy of this event because I understand the importance of history of a people and a nation. “I am happy that we are trying in Nigeria now to return history into the curriculum of our secondary school system. “Yes, if Abaribe fails to tell his story, by the time others tell the story, he will not be able to recognise himself anymore
