By George Okoh Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Monday said the latest result of his COVID-19 test had returned positive. This follows the test results of most of the governorâ€™s close aides who also returned positive in the last few weeks. Though the governor has not shown any symptoms of the disease, he has already commenced treatment as prescribed by medical personnel. He advises those who have come in contact with him in the last couple of days to go for test. The Governor said it was equally important that those who came in contact with other persons who had tested positive for the virus should go for test to ascertain their COVID-19 status. Governor Ortom urged Benue people to continue to observe the protocol for the prevention of the virus such as wearing of face masks, use of sanitizers, regular hand washing and physical distancing. He encourages the people not to be afraid of going for COVID-19 test as only doing so would help in containing the spread of the disease.
