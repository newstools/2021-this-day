Rebecca Ejifoma Following the arrest of 13 suspected traffic robbers in Lagos, the State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has reiterated the command’s commitment to eradicate traffic robbery in the state. The CP made the assertion Thursday at the Command Headquarters in Ikeja. The suspects are: Akeredola Taiwo, 33; Oriyomi Solola, 28; Olanrewaju Sikiru, 25; Hakeem Ridwan, 22; Joseph Ovie, 33; Muhammadu Aminu, 32; and Monday Nweke 35. Others are: Emmanuel Anthony, 24; Onyeka Muoghara, 40; Salaudeen Rilwan, 32; Kayode Dele, 31; Silas Manner, 27; and Favour Elijah, 26. They were arrested by operatives of Rapid Response Squad (RRS) on Wednesday while lurking around Motorways, Old Toll-Gate and Olusosun Dump site, Ojota, Lagos. According to the Commander RRS, CSP Yinka Egbeyemi, some of the suspects were caught red-handed while taking drugs in their hideouts around the corridor. He added that they were actually fingered and recognised by residents and eye witnesses to have been involved in some of the previous traffic robberies and other crimes perpetrated in the areas. Therefore, the CP ordered that the suspects be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) for proper investigation and possible prosecution. Odumosu, however, assured the public of the command’s relentless efforts in eradicating traffic robbery and providing adequate security for all and sundry in the State.
