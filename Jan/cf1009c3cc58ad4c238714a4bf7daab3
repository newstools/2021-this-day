By Chinedu Eze As the global aviation industry grapples with the second wave of the dreaded Corona virus pandemic, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has stepped up measures to ensure the safety of travelling passengers and other airport users across the nation. From the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, to Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, Port Harcourt International Airport, Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport and others within its network, the authority said it is not leaving any stone unturned in ensuring the safe and secured facilitation of travellers. In a statement signed by its General Manager , Public Affairs, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, FAAN said a new operational arrangement is in place across airports, including car parks, which have been rearranged for seamless pick-up and drop off to avoid congestion. The authority, she said, has also created new drop off zones for passengers with reduced mobility. Yakubu said: “Operational and directional signages have also been conspicuously remarked at both the airsides and landsides to make movements easier for airport users and to promote social distancing protocols.” “Additionally, we have intensified the process of disinfecting all baggage before entering the terminals, as well as enhanced temperature screening of all passengers and staff using infrared scanners. We have also separated access entry points for passengers and staff to reduce congestion and improve on facilitation.” She further said: “The authority will like to use this opportunity to advise all travellers and airport users to strictly abide by all laid down travel protocols and also reiterate that only passengers will be allowed into the terminals. “A compliance monitoring team has been constituted for each of our airports to drive total compliance.”
