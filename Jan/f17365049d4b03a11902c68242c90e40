By Onyebuchi Ezigbo All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Senator Bola Tinubu, is hale and hearty, his spokesman, Mr. Tunde Rahman, said yesterday. Rahman, reacting to reports that Tinubu had contracted COVID-19 and was flown to France for treatment, explained that his principal was in the United Kingdom resting after months of vigorous activities in Nigeria, including trips to Kano and Maiduguri. Tinubu’s son, Seyi, also dismissed reports that his father tested positive for COVID-19.
The social media has been abuzz with reports that the former Lagos State governor is currently receiving treatment for COVID-19 in France. But Seyi, in a post via his Instastory yesterday, quoted Rahman as saying Tinubu has done the COVID-19 test 15 times and tested negative on each occasion. According to him, his father is currently in the UK taking a vaccine instead. He said: “According to Tunde Rahman, spokesperson for Bola Tinubu, Asiwaju is not in Paris and he doesn’t have Coronavirus. “That’s a lie from the pit of hell because my father is very ok neither does he have the virus.
“If you must know, he has done the COVID-19 test 15 times, each time he travels and mingles with many people though he always wore a face mask. “He is currently in London taking a vacation and there’s no iota of truth in the false information being shared,” he stated.
