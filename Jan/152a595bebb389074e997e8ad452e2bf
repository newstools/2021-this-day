By Victor Ogunje The Ekiti State Police Command has charged the newly commissioned 256 Special Constabulary officers on professionalism, discipline and patriotism, to be able to collaborate with conventional security agencies to rid the country of insecurity. Addressing the new special constabularies in Ado Ekiti yesterday, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Babatunde Mobayo, congratulated the new recruits, urging them to meticulously follow the rules of engagement as enshrined in the Special Constabulary Police Manual and the Nigerian Police Acts. He said: “I enjoin you to be disciplined, professional, pay attention to your various communities, find out their needs and proffer appropriate solutions to them. “You should ensure that they contribute their quota to your various communities security-wise.” Meanwhile, the state Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, who was represented by his Special Adviser on Security Matters, Ebenezer Ogundana, described the recruitment as apt, considering the current security challenges facing the country, which he said needed to be tackled effectively. The governor further enjoined them to always respect and uphold the tenets of their callings; do their best to make their families, the Nigeria Police and the country at large, proud. “I sympathise with the families of the police officers and all those who lost their loved ones during the #EndSARS protest, which was hijacked by hoodlums. “I also plead with the new recruits to adhere strictly to all the rules guiding the protection of human rights while performing their duties,” the governor advised.
