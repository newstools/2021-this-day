by Bennett Oghifo Toyota (Nigeria) Limited (TNL) shone like a million stars when it recently won the Automobile Brand of The Year Award at the prestigious Nigeria Business Leadership Awards organised by Business Day Newspaper. TNL came tops in the Autobrand Category, after a rigorous assessment by a carefully selected panel of judges, in the keenly contested category. Speaking at the event, the Managing Director, Mr. Kunle Ade-Ojo dedicated the award to the teeming customers of Toyota, assuring them that the company will continue to offer the best in sales and aftersales. He added that the company will continue to put in place structures that will add value to the company’s service delivery to ensure that our customers remain happy and committed to the brand. In the company’s tradition of making their customers happy, a budget vehicle will be launched in the first quarter of 2021. Expectedly, the vehicle is imbued with the superior quality and beauty of Toyota and worth looking forward to its introduction into the Nigerian market. He thanked all customers of the brand for their patronage and promised that the company will not relent on its mission of making happy customers.
