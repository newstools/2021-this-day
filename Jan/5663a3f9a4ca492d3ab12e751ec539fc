By Hammed Shittu It was a palpable confusion at the Kwara State Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development on Jebba Road in Ilorin, when a Director in the ministry, Dr. Khalid Ibrahim Ndaman, was found dead in his office. THISDAY checks revealed that Ndaman, who until his death was a director at the Veterinary department in the ministry, was sighted coming to office yesteday morning hale and hearty. Further checks revealed that it was when one of the staff members went to see him about an hour after his arrival, to discuss a pending official matter with him, that he discovered him dead. It was further learnt that Ndaman was resting his head on the table, but already dead. One of the staff members, who craved anonymity, told THISDAY in an interview yesterday that “the worker knocked his (director) door, but there was no response so, after sometime he went inside the office. There was a pending official matter since last Friday that he needed to conclude with him (director) so he needed to see him. “Having waited outside and no response after knocking, the staff member went inside the office and met him resting his head on the table. He greeted him but there was no response until he moved closer and touched him to realise that he’s already dead.” When contacted, the Spokesman of state police command, Ajayi Okasanmi, confirmed the incident. He said: “I’m aware of the incident. For now, it’s a case of sudden natural death until we complete investigation. We will brief journalists depending on the outcome of our findings.” On whether there has been any arrest over the incident, he said there was none.
