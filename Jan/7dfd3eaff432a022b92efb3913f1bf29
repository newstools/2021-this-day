By Deji Elumoye Chairman of the Senate committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to give the newly appointed service chiefs a time frame to address the insurgency and other security challenges facing the nation. Ndume who spoke with journalists stated that as an individual he believed that the war against the terrorists being fought by the military can be concluded within the next six months. He also canvassed for proper coordination of the activities of the new crop of service chiefs for better results. “The President should give the service Chiefs a timeline since they now have everything they need. If they don’t perform as expected, government should not waste time to sack them. I believe that if the new set are given what they need, to execute the war, they would tackle insurgency, banditry and all forms of criminality. The National Security Adviser (NSA) should monitor and coordinate their activities. He should report to the President on daily or weekly basis so that there would be a timeline. “I believe that the insecurity war could be brought to an end within six months if the current crop of service chiefs is given what they needed. There must be a timeline. “There must be a work plan for insurgency and work plan for the banditry. The President should ask the Service chiefs to give him the time within which they would end the insurgency and the time provided will determine their tenure. If they don’t perform, government should not waste time in replacing them. The war could be brought to an end before the raining season start. “Therefore, the beginning of the raining season should be the target for the issue of insurgency especially in the North East”.
