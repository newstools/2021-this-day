The widow of the late Peoples Democratic Party, Zonal Chairman, the late Matthew Kola-Ojo, Mrs. Yemi Kola-Ojo, was among the 14 persons kidnapped on Monday in Okunland, Kogi State. The victims were reportedly kidnapped while travelling between Iffe and Egbeda, in the Ijumu Local Government Area. The journey was said to be her first trip from Okoro-Gbede after concluding the mandatory mourning period of her husband, but was kidnapped on her way back. However, five persons were later released by the kidnappers but the late PDP zonal chairman’s wife was held captive. The President, Okun Development Association (ODA), Chief Femi Mokikan, said eight persons were released. He also said the kidnappers had established contact with a relative of Mrs. Kola-Ojo but were yet to demand ransom. “The persons they (kidnappers) called was a family member, telling him they have Mrs. Kola-Ojo in their custody. But before they could state their ransom, the man’s phone experienced flat battery. We are hoping that they will call back today”. He said ODA in collaboration with the Ijumu LGA were working for their release.
