*Iwobi on scorers’ sheet as Everton beat Wolves Paul Pogba’s well-drilled volley gave Manchester United 1-0 victory at Burnley to take them top of the Premier League. The Frenchman’s second-half strike proved decisive in another game high on video assistant referee (VAR) drama. Harry Maguire had a goal disallowed for United in a first half dominated by VAR reviews, with Burnley’s Robbie Brady and United’s Luke Shaw appearing fortunate to escape earlier red cards.

The Toffees’ sixth away win in the league this season lifted them level on points with third-place Leicester and only four off the lead held by Manchester United They got off to a brilliant start when Iwobi fired home in the fifth minute for his first goal in 38 Premier League appearances. Wolves, seeking only their second win in eight games, hit back in the 14th minute through Ruben Neves. The Portuguese midfielder ended his own barren run against Brighton at the start of January, and made it two goals in two league matches with a sublime sidefoot finish following brilliant movement from Rayan Ait-Nouri.
