BonnyLight Energy and Offshore Limited, a wholly indigenous petroleum downstream company, has announced its latest supply of 20,000 metric tonnes of diesel to the Nigerian market, with a pledge to maintain steady supply of products to the market. The company said the product lifted from Amsterdam, Netherland would serve key markets situated across the region through its base in Kirikiri, Ijegun, and Creek Road in Lagos; Warri and Oghara in Delta State as well as Port Harcourt, Rivers State. It said the product supplies came at the crucial times occasioned by high consumption of diesel from corporates, transporting institutions and even households, and aimed at ensuring product security across all sectors. The Vice Chairman of BonnyLight Energy and Offshore Limited, Mr. Toyin Banjo, said in a statement that “BonnyLight is proud to be an active member of the industry’s stakeholder community committed to the continual delivery of premium fuel that drives our fast-emerging economy amid the recession and the attendant COVID-19 pandemic era. “Furthermore, we are poised to support the Federal Government’s efforts to revamp the energy sector and successfully steer the economy towards a fully market-led and deregulated regime in the downstream petroleum sector,” it added. He said additionally, the inflow of BonnyLight’s 20,000MT premium diesel supply will significantly aid the country’s manufacturing industry to ramp up production and post COVID-19 lull. With Nigeria’s daily petrol consumption put at 56 million litres by the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Authority (PPPRA), BonnyLight Energy said it intends to help maintain product supply stability in the country.
