The election went south for Donald Trump. Truth is he visits his great wall that has nearly as many holes as his credibility. Since his election 452 miles have been built at a cost of 15 billion so far or just over three million dollars a mile. So there must be some very well paid fence builders and if they finish the other 1500 or so miles they will be able to retire wealthy. In time all that will be left is small bit of wall left which might be graffitied by a black marker pen saying “I won but they stole it” and “Trump 2024, 2028, 2032…” but they will all be crossed out. Visit the border but just stay on the Mexican side until they pay for it. Dennis Fitzgerald,
