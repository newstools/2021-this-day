Well Mr. Trump, you were right, some polls could be rigged!
The annual Gallup poll for the most admired man in the world has placed Donald Trump at the top of the list and not for the first time. One of the problems with politics and polls is that it is not always the result you expected or wanted. I can accept that Michelle Obama was the most admired woman in the world but at the same stage shouldn’t it now be the most admired person? Interestingly the top people for the 20th century only included three politicians in the top 10 with Mother Theresa being the most admired. Doing charitable works is more important and produces a better outcome for many.
