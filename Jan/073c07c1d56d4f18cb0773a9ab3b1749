The Development Bank of Nigeria Plc has donated relief materials to economically challenged individuals and widows in rural communities of Keana – Nasarawa, Madagalli – Adamawa, and Bakassi in Cross River State. The initiative was intended to alleviate the challenges being faced by the affected communities. Speaking on the donation, DBN Managing Director, Tony Okpanachi, was quoted in a statement to have said the posture of the bank which is anchored on giving back to the society in which it operates, motivated it to present the donations as part of its corporate social responsibility. He added that the gesture was aimed at sustaining previous efforts by the bank to support the cause of the displaced persons, widows, and to rehabilitate victims of insurgency.
