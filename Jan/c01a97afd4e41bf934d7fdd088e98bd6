David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano has lifted the suspension of three traditional rulers in the state. The three traditional rulers were among the 12 suspended in September last year for allegedly traveling out of their domain to Abuja, without permission from the governor. The monarchs had joined billionaire oil mogul, Arthur Eze on a trip to Abuja to visit President Muhammadu Buhari. Obiano who was then at feud with Eze for accusing him of shortchanging monarchs in the state brought the hammer down on the monarchs for alleged insubordination to him by the monarchs. But in a statement signed by the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Matters, Mr. Greg Obi, the governor lifted the one year suspension slammed on three of the traditional rulers involved. Commissioner Obi said, “His Excellency, Governor Willie Obiano in a new year act of magnanimity has decided to lift the suspension of three traditional rulers. “The affected Igwes are: Igwe NN. Kelly Nkeli – Igbariam, Igwe Dr. Emeka Ilouno – Ifitedunu, Igwe Peter Uyanwa – Ukwulu.” The statement further directs that the lifting of the suspension takes effect immediately. The state government had previously announced the removal of some of the traditional rulers who embarked on the trip, including Igwe Chijioke Nwankwo of Nawfia Community, who has also gone to court to challenge his removal. Nwankwo in a recent interview with THISDAY said the governor had no powers to remove him as he has neither offended culture nor the people, two reasons he said were stipulated in the traditional rulers Act as reason any monarch could be removed. Nwankwo urged the state government to immediately reinstate him.
