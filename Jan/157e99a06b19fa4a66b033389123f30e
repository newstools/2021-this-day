By Fred Ojeh The umbrella body of Ndigbo worldwide, the Igbo World Assembly (IWA), has stated that after painstakingly reviewing and assessing the pre-election issues and the alleged electoral irregularities in the recent Ohanaeze election, it has rejected the just concluded parallel Ohanaeze Ndigbo elections. This is even as the group called for caretaker committee of Ohanaeze Ndigbo for about three months to ensure unity of Ndigbo and also to conduct credible, free and fair election that will follow due process. The global Igbo body also expressed disappointment over the failure of Ohanaeze to conduct elections that promotes Igbo unity, progress and development. IWA after a worldwide meeting held recently jointly signed a statement by its Chairman, Dr. Nwachukwu Anakwenze; the Vice Chairman, Christian Onuorah, and the Secretary General, Oliver Nwankwor, stating that it has critically reviewed, assessed and analysed the issues and circumstances that led to the ‘elections of disunity in Ohanaeze Ndigbo in particular and Igbo nation in general’. According to the statement, “It is our solemn duty to Ndigbo to communicate and share our findings which serve as the basis of our decision, and which will guide our future actions.” Speaking on the elections irregularities, IWA noted without mincing words that Prince Okwukwu’s faction of the Ohanaeze election was held in secrecy without transparency.
