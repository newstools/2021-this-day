By Davidson Iriekpen A former Enugu State Governor, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani, has said that the agitations and restiveness in parts of the country could be curtailed and eradicated if infrastructure development and appointments into key offices in government are based on fairness, equity and justice. Nnamani, who is representing Enugu East Senatorial District at the National Assembly, stated this in a goodwill message to Nigerians marking the New Year Day He noted that any action or policy of government that tends to offend the sensibilities of citizens would always produce negative results. Nnamani, therefore, canvassed an egalitarian society where every citizen is free to carry out his or her legitimate business in any part of the country without fear of intimidation or molestation. He urged governments at all levels to ensure justice, fairness and equity in the affairs of the country in order to give every section of the country a sense of belonging. This, he said, was a necessary antidote to disharmony in the country and an elixir to command national loyalty for all citizens. He said, “The governments at all levels would earn the trust, respect and confidence of the citizens if fairness and equity becomes the grund norm for policies and programmes.” The two-time governor of Enugu State was hopeful that the federal government would in 2021 provide the needed roadmap to address the inherent imbalances in the affairs of Nigeria. He expressed the hope that governments would provide the needed leadership to address the multifaceted problems including insecurity, unemployment and other economic challenges facing the nation in the New Year.
