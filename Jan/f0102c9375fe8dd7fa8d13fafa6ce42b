This development delights me as it again shows the growth of the game and its resilience particularly during this era of COVID-19. “Let me therefore specially thank the Nigerian Polo Federation and the leadership of the Jos Polo Club for consistently hosting this tournament. The sponsorship by NASCO Group of Companies and other corporate bodies has steadily enhanced the quality of the annual tournament and also created more awareness on the game of polo in Nigeria and Plateau State.
