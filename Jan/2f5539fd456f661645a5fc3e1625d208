 Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, has said for the sake of his sanity, he would not want to discuss any issue concerning the regime of President Muhammadu Buhari. Soyinka said this during a recent interview with Kaftan TV. Speaking onboard the new train, the Nobel Laureate said he would not like to talk about Buhari’s government because he imagined the regime doesn’t exist. In the short interview currently tranding on the social media, Soyinka when asked whether the new train was a plus to Buhari’s regime, said: “I don’t want to talk about Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. I think it is best for my sanity just to avoid that overall question. I can take bits and pieces of Nigeria’s present predicament but I think for one’s sense of balance, one must forget the existence of the Buhari administration.”
