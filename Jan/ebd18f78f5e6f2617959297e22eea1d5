Barcelona are reportedly still in the running to sign Real Madrid target, David Alaba, from Bayern Munich. Madrid are believed to have stepped forward with a lucrative offer for Alaba, who is due to become a free agent in the summer. The Austria international is holding off from making a decision over his future until April, though, and Sky Sports Deutschland suggests that Barca will be in a position to discuss personal terms with the versatile defender before then. Alabaâ€™s advisor Pini Zahavi is said to be confident of interest from Barca once a new president is in place at Camp Nou in March, with the elections having been pushed back from this month. Zahavi is close friends with presidential frontrunner Joan Laporta, which it is claimed would give the Catalan giants a big advantage over La Liga rivals Madrid. Bayern have not given up hope of persuading Alaba to extend his contract at the Allianz Arena, but the 28-year-old turned down multiple offers towards the end of 2020.
