The prayers of basketball players plying their trade in the domestic league got a major boost as a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Tuesday threw out the case brought before it by the Kwese League Management Board and others forbidding the Nigeria Basketball Federation, NBBF from organising the Premier Basketball League. The case which was instituted in 2018 by the Kwese League Management Board, Ibrahim Saad, who is Chairman of Gombe Bulls and others according to Justice A. I. Chikere lacked merit and as such is thrown out. According to a board member of the NBBF, Victor Okoro who was in the Federal High Court 3 in Maitama, Abuja, the judgment has finally closed the matter which has been on for over three years. “This is victory for Nigeria basketball and particularly for the many talents that have been denied a livelihood over the years due to the case being in court,” he told reporters at the court premises in Abuja. The Nigeria Basketball Federation over the years had come under attack from various interest groups that before now believed that the board led by Engr. Ahmadu Musa Kida didn’t have the interest of players in the domestic league at heart but according to the Vice President of the NBBF Babs Ogunade, the court ruling brings back hope as sponsors would be willing to associate their brands with the Federation. “This is good news and we’re particularly excited that this is over as we can plan properly with sponsors to have our premium programme back on track. Our players in the domestic scene can look forward to a fresh and reinvigorated Premier Basketball League.”
