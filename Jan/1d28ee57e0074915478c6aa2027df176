Human rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) has called for caution over the herdsmen crisis in Ondo State. In a statement issued yesterday, Falana acknowledged that the federal government and the various state governments had embarked on a number of measures to curb the menace of criminal gangs that currently control the monopoly of violence throughout the country. The senior lawyer recommended that in view of the total collapse of the security architect of the country, the federal government should summon an emergency meeting of the Nigeria Police Council to deliberate and take drastic measures on the security situation in all the states of the Federation. He also called on the federal government to mobilise adequate police and other security forces to halt the menace of kidnapping, banditry, terrorism, armed robbery and other violent crimes in the land. With respect to the brewing crisis in Ondo State, he called on Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to extend the seven-day ultimatum to allow all farmers and herders operating in the forest reserve to register with the state government without any delay. Falana also suggested that Miyetti Allah and similar groups should ensure that all their members who have not registered with the state government do so without any further delay in the overall interest of the security of the people in the State. He also urged Akeredolu to revitalise the abandoned Akunu Ranch in the Akoko Area of the state with a view to producing and distributing meat in a safe and healthy environment. â€œAll registered herders and other people involved in animal husbandry will be accommodated in the proposed ranch. With adequate security no group of criminal elements will be permitted to hide in the ranch to carry out nefarious activities.
