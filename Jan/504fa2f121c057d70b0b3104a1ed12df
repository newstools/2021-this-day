By David-Chyddy Eleke The immediate past president of Transnational Corporation, Plc (Transcorp), Mr Valentine Ozigbo has lamented the high debt profile of Anambra State under the leadership of Governor Willie Obiano. Ozigbo, quoting the Debt Management Office during a media briefing yesterday said the state’s debt profile has risen by 1,600 per cent since Obiano became governor of the state. He added that what was more annoying was that the infrastructure on ground in the state was not commensurate with the humongous sum already borrowed since 2014. The ex-banker said, “Anambra’s debt profile under this government has risen by 1,600 per cent since this administration came in 2014. For bankers like us, we like to make meaning off numbers.” Ozigbo, who is also a governorship aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said he was in the race to lead Anambra to the path of greatness again, insisting that if the state makes a mistake in the next election about who governs her, she will regret it for many years. “I’m here (governorship race) because I want our story to change. I am here because I’m not satisfied with the status-quo. We need to change the way people look at politicians, we need to change the way people see Anambra. I’m convinced that I have the capacity to bring the kind of change we yearn for. “I want to be the answer to the prayer of the poor masses for a good leader. I have the capacity, and not just my ability to do it alone, but being personally authentic and the humility to admit what I do not have, and what I do not know. “The problem we have is that we have too many people who think they know it all. What I don’t know, I know where to get someone who knows it. I have emotional intelligence and I am grateful to God for it. “I want to tell Anambra people that we must be careful in choosing the next governor of the state. If we make any mistake in the next person that will be governor, it will be recipe for disaster.”
