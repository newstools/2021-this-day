Emmanuel Ugwu in Umuahia A frontline politician and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Alex Otti has called for vigilance among Nigerians in this season of festivities, following the resurgence of COVID-19 pandemic. He made the call in his message to Abians, titled “Saved by the creator to celebrate the birth of Christ,” saying that he remained grateful to God for protecting Nigerians in the midst of the turbulence that characterised 2020. Otti stated that the festive season should not be an occasion for people to drop their guards, adding that all COVID-19 protocols should be observed so that lives would be preserved in the New Year after celebration. In the yuletide message, signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Ferdinand Ekeoma, Otti specifically recalled “the fear, sorrow and death unleashed by the Coronavirus pandemic which gravely threatened and continues to threaten humanity.” However, the renowned economist and financial expert acknowledged that God did not allow the pandemic to wreak the kind of havoc earlier predicted for Nigeria. He said that surviving the pandemic, the socio-political and economic challenges of 2020 that faced mankind was of divine making. “We have had a 2020 that was full of frightening turbulence, trials and tribulations that challenged the faith of many Christians, but we must remain strong in faith, knowing that God does not abandon his children, hence He saved us to celebrate,” Otti said. Otti also advised his fellow Abians “not to lose focus on the essence of Christmas which is the celebration of the birth of the son of God whose exemplary life of love, peace, selflessness and sacrifice has remained unmatched throughout human existence.” He enjoined all to avoid any act capable of causing breach of the peace in Abia in particular, and Nigeria as a whole, adding that any untoward act would defeat the essence of celebrating the birth of Christ, the Prince of peace.
