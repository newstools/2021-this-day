By Michael Olugbode President Muhammadu Buhari has said the former Vice-Chancellor of University of Lagos (UNILAG) and Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of First Technical University, Ibadan, Prof. Oyewusi Ibidapo-Obe, who died on Sunday will be sorely missed. Buhari, in a statement on Monday by his Special Adviser on Media & Publicity, Femi Adesina, while commiserating with the academia over the passing of the former UNILAG vice-chancellor and condoling with family members and friends, said the scholar and administrator will be sorely missed by the academia, government and the country as his sudden transition has left a gap that will be difficult to fill. The president lauded Ibidapo-Obe’s contribution to the development of education, with a rich pedigree of being President of the Nigerian Academy of Science, Chairman of the Committee of Vice Chancellors of Nigerian Universities and upward rising over the years with a distinguished career. President Buhari also condoled with students and staff of UNILAG, First Technical University and the Nigeria Universities Commission (NUC) over the loss, as well as the government and people of Osun State. He prayed for the repose of the soul of the scholar, and God’s comfort for his family.
