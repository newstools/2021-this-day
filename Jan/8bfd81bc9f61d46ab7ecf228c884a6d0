The cryptic message by Donald Trump on the day he departed the White House, “we’ll be back in some form,” will dominate political discussions for a couple of years into the Joe Biden presidency. What did Trump really mean? It is said that, as a result of age and depending on his state of health in 2024 plus his belief in the Democratic Party’s “liberalism and feminism,” Joe Biden may not seek a second term and so the coast will be clear, if you will, for the “Caucasoid-Black-Asian” VP, Kamala Harris, to run for president. Donald Trump, in his cryptic McDouglas Arthureque quip, actually meant he will push Ivanka Trump-Kushner into the fray. Then, it will be a “woman-to-woman, Jew’s wife versus Jew’s wife” fight between two beautiful ladies whose mothers were “modern immigrants” to the US; that would be an evenly-poised contest. Ivanka’s popularity pre-2024 will soar if security in the mainland US takes a knock as a result of Biden reversing Trump’s “travel ban” Executive Order; to ensure that this does not happen, since Democrats will be rightly tensed as this particular travel ban is lifted and pissed-off grizzled reactionaries enter stateside and sneer at a “decadent” America, Biden, Harris and the likes of Ilhan Omar will have a lot of “cooling-off talks” to do as they criss-cross America. Otherwise, Ivanka will run her 2024 campaign exactly on the format of her dad Donald by threatening a second, more comprehensive and punitive “travel ban.” Sure, the Democrats will not rest easy these next four years. Trump will see to that.
