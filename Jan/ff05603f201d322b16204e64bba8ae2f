Manchester City star Sergio Aguero is reportedly wanted by Barcelona. Aguero’s future at City is uncertain with the 32-year-old coming out of contract at the end of the season. And the forward is unsurprisingly wanted by Europe’s biggest clubs. Barcelona are eyeing Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero, according to The Sun. Aguero has also been linked to Paris Saint-Germain as City’s all-time leading goalscorer entered the final six months of his contract. Also, Eric Garcia is tipped to join the Barca from City. The cover of Mundo Deportivo says Garcia is poised to move to Barca in January in a deal worth €5million (£4.5m) plus variables. UK’s The Telegraph also reported yesterday that Fernandinho is undecided about his future, with the City man having offers from South America.
