By John Shiklam The Nigerian Army has deployed 300 female combatant soldiers along the Kaduna-Abuja highway to check the incessant killings and kidnappings by bandits. The Kaduna state Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, yesterday received the first batch of 100 of the female soldiers, known as Nigeria Army Women Corps (NAWC). The female soldiers are to complement the existing operations along the highways and the environs. Speaking while receiving the female soldiers along the Kaduna- Abuja road, El-Rufai, expressed the hope that with the deployment of the female soldiers, the insecurity along the highways will soon be a thing of the past. He commended the military for deploying the troops and assured of the continued support of the Kaduna State government. El-Rufai said: “The problem of Abuja-Kaduna road will be over with these female soldiers because what a man can do a woman can do better. We believe in the capability of women in this state. “I am confident the road will be the safest in Nigeria. We will do everything possible to make this operation comfortable. “We are very happy to have you. Your presence will inspire others girls to join the military.That is why we have female deputy governor to inspire other women”.
