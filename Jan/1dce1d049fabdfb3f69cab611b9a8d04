By Laleye Dipo The Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, has stated that all ongoing capital projects embarked upon by the administration will be completed before May 2023. Bello gave the assurance in a New Year message to the people of the state in which he also pledged to restore peace, law and order to all parts of the state presently facing banditry attacks and other forms of insecurity. The governor said both the state and federal governments are working hard and evolving fresh strategies towards bringing insecurity to an end, adding that government is displeased with the way banditry and kidnapping have made life unbearable for the people. Bello noted that government’s proactive way in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic was effective in containing the spread of the virus in the state and therefore urged the people to do more by observing the protocols, because the intensity of the second wave looks more scary. In a similar message, the Special Adviser to the governor on Political Matters Alhaji Nma Kolo, urged politicians to strive to maintain the relative political peace being enjoyed in the state. Kolo said that politicians should ply their trade by taking the peace of the state into account, adding that nothing tangible can be achieved in an atmosphere of chaos. “As we approach the 2023 general election, political activities will surely increase. We should go about our activities with the interest of the peace of our state and country at the back of our minds,” Kolo said. The governor’s aide solicited the support and cooperation of the people to the state government to enable it deliver more dividends of democracy to the people.
