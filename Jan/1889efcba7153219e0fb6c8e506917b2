By Onungwe Obe Former President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, has reminded mothers of the sacred duty to bring up children that will reform the society. The former president stated this yesterday at Anyama-Ogbia, Bayelsa State, where he paid a condolence visit to the family of the late Madam Molly Ogoun. He said he was appreciative of the crucial role of women in child upbringing, and would like mothers to pay adequate attention to their parenting roles. The former Nigerian leader said the foundation of a good society is laid from the home. The late Ogoun, a community leader, died in November 2020. Two of her children, Christian priests, are friends of Jonathan. He praised the late matriarch of Ogoun family for living an exemplary life. Jonathan called on the children to emulate their late mother, who he described as a devoted Christian that dedicated her life to the service of God and humanity. In his condolence message to the family, he said: “I commiserate with the Ogoun and Egirani families on the demise of your dear mother, who passed away at the age of 82 years. “Mama was a devoted Christian who dedicated her time to serving God and humanity. Her honesty, kindness and dedication to good causes endeared her to many in her family and community.” Also, Chief Benson Agadaga, an ally of Jonathan, who accompanied him on the visit, described the late Ogoun as an epitome of peace and a disciplinarian. Agadaga, who is the Chief of Staff to Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, noted that mothers all over the world have been support bases to their children and families. According to him, the honesty, peaceful disposition and cordiality of the children of the late Ogoun is attributed to the way in which she raised them. The former president was received by children of the deceased, Apostle Manager Ogoun, Peter Ogoun and Dr. Stanley Ogoun, a lecturer at Niger Delta University, who expressed appreciation to Jonathan for the visit.
