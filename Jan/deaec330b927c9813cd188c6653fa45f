Alex Enumah in Abuja The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, Wednesday, swore in Justice Salisu Garba as Acting Chief Judge (CJ) of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Justice Garba will be in acting capacity pending his confirmation as substantive CJ by the Senate. Meanwhile, the CJN has urged the new Acting CJ to be honest in the handling of all issues before him. Muhammad noted that Garba must put in more effort to meet with the demands of his new office. He also told Justice Garba to gird his loins to give his best in his new task so as to contribute towards the progress of the nation. He said: “We must not rest on our oars if we are truly desirous of attaining new heights and conquering seemingly difficult situations. “As the head of the FCT Judiciary, we expect nothing short of the best from you. The buck stops at your desk and you must always be honest enough to be dispassionate in handling all issues before you.” While expressing confidence that the acting CJ will function well in his new office, the CJN advised him not to be tempted to violate or desecrate any fraction of the oath he had taken. He therefore charged him to be of “good character, just as you have always been, endeavour to consistently hoist the banner of honesty and integrity, hold aloft the mantle of transparency and dispassionate disposition”. The CJN called on Justice Garba to inspire confidence in his subordinates and also present an ideal image of a father figure. President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the appointment of Justice Garba as acting CJ of the FCT following the retirement of Justice Ishaq Usman Bello on Tuesday, having attained the mandatory retirement age of 65 years for High Court judges.
