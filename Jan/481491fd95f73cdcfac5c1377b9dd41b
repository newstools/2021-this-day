By Rebecca Ejifoma Seventy shops and several goods have been destroyed following the Tuesday early morning inferno at the Slade market in Shomolu area of Lagos State. The incident, which erupted at 1.05am, was said to possibly be from a voltage surge after power supply was restored. The DG/CEO Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu said the agency responded to distress calls at 1.05am. He added: “Upon arrival, we commenced fire suppression activities. The agency fire fighters alongside the Lagos State and Federal Fire Services worked to complete a thorough damping down exercise.” According to Oke-Osanyintolu, initial post disaster assessment indicates that 70 lock-up shops were affected while the extent of destroyed goods is still being assessed. While noting that operation has been concluded, the DG implored residents to ensure their appliances were switched off when not in use to prevent voltage surges.
