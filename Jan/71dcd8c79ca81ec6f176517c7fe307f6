By Ibrahim Shuaibu The Kano State Government yesterday disclosed that it has discovered seven more children allegedly stolen from the state and transferred to Anambra and Enugu States. The Kano State Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba, told journalists yesterday, saying the state government has already identified the kids, and that they will be reunited soon. The police had in 2019 declared that nine children were kidnapped in Kano in separate incidents, and were allegedly renamed and sold off in Onitsha, Anambra State. The commissioner said pictures and video footage of the missing-but-found children were taken and disseminated, which prompted five parents to identify their children. Garba said the children would soon be reunited with their parents after scrutiny. It was also learnt that some of the parents, whose children were abducted earlier, formed a group to pressure the government with protest and consultation to expedite action towards securing the release of their children. Mr. Ibrahim Ismail, the leader of the group, expressed delight over the latest development leading to the discovery of seven more stolen children. According to him, “We’re happy with the discovery; only two children among the seven found are yet to be identified by their parents. However, we are still searching for 113 children who are still missing.”
