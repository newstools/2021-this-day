Nancy Poloni has signed the second Trump impeachment document and finally itâ€™s not fake news that Donald Trump has achieved something no other president has. When you see the document it is clear that the signature is small and the words are of massive importance whereas with recent Executive orders the signature is massive and the words are of a small importance. Most people want to return to a world where troubles are small and happiness is massive. This should start in less than a week. Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne, Australia
