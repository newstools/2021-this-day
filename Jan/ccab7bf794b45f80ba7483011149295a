HighLife There are speculations circulating regarding the figure behind a Nigerian airline, Ibom Air. The airline is the state property of Akwa Ibom, something that Governor Emmanuel Udom waxed merry about during its launch in 2019: that his Akwa Ibom is the only state with its own airline and airport. However, folks with better insider information have alleged that the airline is, for all intents and purposes, the property of prominent Nigerian oil and gas magnate, Akanimo Udofia. Akanimo Udofia (alias AK-47) is the managing director of Desicom Engineering, a frontline company with interests in the “provision of innovative Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) solutions for Nigeria’s oil and gas industries.” Udofia was educated at the University of Uyo, obtaining a degree in Business Administration) and Harvard University (MBA). These qualified him to take over Desicom Engineering from his father, Obong Asuquo Udofia, and eventually raised it into an A-list company, servicing multinational toppers of the energy sector, like Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron. The man lives in such comfort and style that he had already begun to traverse the clouds in his private jet long before his peers realised that one could own a private jet! Thus, one does not need the twittering of little media birds to see the width of Udofia’s wealth or spy the depth of his influence. With such width and depth, Udofia is reportedly able to clasp hands with Akwa Ibom governor, engage in tête-à-tête, and play the role of a chief adviser all day long. Those in the thick of things have stated that this same Akanimo Udofia was able to deliver with Ibom Air, and has been the backbone of the whole gig. Of course, others (who are tight with the billionaire) deny his participation in the establishment and operation of Ibom Air.
