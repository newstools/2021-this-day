The two of them were gunned down and they died instantly. “But what surprised me was that those at the scene said patrol vehicle belonging to Operation Safe Haven (military taskforce) was on the road when the incident happened but the military men did not stop to attend to my son and his friend.” Dantyang appealed to both the government and security agencies to fish out the perpetrators of the attack.
