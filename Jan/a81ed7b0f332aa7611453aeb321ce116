By Adibe Emenyonu The family of the Edo State-born business mogul and philanthropist, Capt Well Idahosa Okunbor, yesterday described as malicious and wicked rumours that their son Okunbor has passed on. The Chairman of Ocean Marine Solutions Limited, Okunbor, had travelled to the United Kingdom on his routine medical checkup, but was being rumoured in some quarters that the business mogul has passed on. However, in a statement signed by Dr. Tinyan Okunbor, on behalf of the Okunbor’s family, the family said: “Their son, father and benefactor shall live beyond the expectations of rumour mongers,” warning that those behind rumoured death of Capt Hosa should desist from it or face the wrath of God. According to the statement, “Our attention has been drawn to the malicious rumours making the rounds that our son, brother, father, grandfather and benefactor has gone to be with the Lord. “We hereby debunk such rumours as they originated from the pit of hell, and hereby state unequivocally that Capt Okunbor is well, hale and hearty. “Our brother, son and father will surely live beyond the rumours, and God will judge those who delight in peddling fatal wishes on the innocent.”
