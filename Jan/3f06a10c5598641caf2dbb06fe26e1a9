A former member of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, representing Uke/Karshi constituency, Mr. Alhassan Gora has been arraigned before the Uke Upper Area Court for assault, breach of public peace as well as dishonest and fraudulent reconnection of electricity. The prosecutor said Gora stole the electricity of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) contrary to sections 264, 286(2), 113 and 114 of the penal code, laws of northern Nigeria. In the First Information Report (FIR) filed before the court, the police also alleged that Gora slapped one Mr. Samson Sabo, a marketer with the AEDC, three times thereby assaulting him while carrying out his official duty in the community. A statement by the AEDC in Abuja, alleged that Gora assaulted its staff who was carrying out his legitimate duty, saying that the ex-lawmaker had reconnected himself without the consent of AEDC, despite an outstanding debt of N324,000.
On arrival at his house, the team led by Mr. Sabo found that Gora had illegally reconnected himself thereby stealing the electricity of AEDC. “AEDC promptly reported the matter to the Uke Division of the Nigeria Police Force who charged him before the Upper Area Court on a one count charge of assault,” the statement added.
It stated that when the matter came up for hearing, the accused person pleaded not guilty and was granted bail for N200, 000. In the alternative, the magistrate, Abdulsalam Abubakar, ordered that he be remanded at the Keffi correctional centre until the next adjourned date, which is February 12, 2020.
