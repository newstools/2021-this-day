Tolu Ajayi, the Director of the short, “Training Day”, was selected as “Best Director” as part of the official Monthly Selection (December 2020) for the ARFF Amsterdam International Awards. “Training Day” is a short film based on Paradigm Initiative’s 2019 Digital Rights in Africa report, featuring the story of a young man whose quest for work took an unexpected turn. The film tells the story of a young man, Jude, (acted by Tomiwa Tegbe) whose quest for work took an unexpected turn. After witnessing for himself what the perceived security company he secured a job in was into, he was turned between accepting the job offer or turn it down. Produced by Bolanle Akintomide, “Training Day” features Sinmiloluwa Hassan Tomiwa Tegbe, Mitchelle-Micheal and others. The 19-minute-long short film features a growing trend of African governments aggressively taking steps to suppress digital rights of Africans. The film subtly but powerfully expresses how governments and agents of State are increasingly making overt and covert moves to muzzle the voices of Africans online and shows the importance of young people being vigilant and aware of their rights.
