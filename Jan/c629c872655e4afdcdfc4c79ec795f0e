Alex Enumah in Abuja Publisher of SaharaReporters, Omoyele Sowore, and four others have been remanded at the Kuje Correctional Center, Abuja, pending the hearing and determination of their bail applications in their alleged public disturbance trial. Chief Magistrate Marble Segun- Bello of a Wuse Zone 2 Magistrate Court, Abuja made the remand order shortly after the defendants were arraigned before her for allegedly embarking on a protest over 2021 crossover celebration. The federal government had on Monday arraigned them on a 3-count charge of Criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly and public disturbance. They were arrested by the Special Weapons Tactical Team in Abuja on January 1, while protesting to mark the New Year celebration. Sowore was said to be leading the protest against bad governance on New Year’s Eve in Abuja. According to the Prosecution, the defendants were seen carrying placards calling for a violent revolution against President Muhammadu Buhari. They however pleaded not guilty to the three-count charge. Following their not guilty plea, prosecuting counsel prayed the court for their remand at the Kuje Correctional Center as investigations into the charges were ongoing. But Counsel to the defendants, Marshal Abubakar, attempted to make an oral application for defendants’ bail, urging the court to grant them bail on self recognizance. In a short ruling Chief Magistrate Segun- Bello ordered that the defendants file a formal bail application and adjourned hearing in the bail till Tuesday, January 5. Meanwhile, the Magistrate ordered that the defendants be remanded in Kuje Correctional Center pending the determination of their bail applications. Sowore had earlier before the protest charged Nigerians on Twitter to hold a crossover protest by picking up a candle and a placard showing their grievances against the President Muhammadu Buhari administration
