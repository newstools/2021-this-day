Yinka Olatunbosun Three days. 19 artists. One incredible year. That’s what the Guild of Professional Fine Artists of Nigeria (GFA) offered art enthusiasts in a show that featured a salon of recent works by top-notch artists and members. A mixed grill of painting, sculpture, drawings and mixed media, the salon ran from Friday December 11 to Sunday December 13. Titled “Impact”, the show not only underlies the plural identity of the GFA but also serves as a thematic preoccupation for such a remarkable year in history. “This exhibition is a manifestation of those fine things of life that have been missing in the preceding months of the year,” says Yinka Fisher, a trustee of the GFA, “Impact, coming at the end of the year, brings us back to those things that are pleasant and beautiful.” Ultimately a reflection of gratitude, this salon revealed how each artist expresses his individual experience in a year where lives and livelihoods have been lost. “After such a challenging period, it is an honour to be able to close out the year with such a beautiful and personal show,” says the curator and Director of the GFA, Ugonna Ibe-Ejiogu, “we are grateful that Hourglass Gallery and our lead sponsor Art.NG have joined us in celebrating some of the finest artists in Nigeria.” The Guild of Professional Fine Artists of Nigeria was positioned to protect and promote the interests of full-time professional artists as well as contribute to the growth and development of the Art industry at large.
