Obinna Chima The Chief Executive Officer of First City Monument Bank Limited (FCMB), Mr. Adam Nuru, has voluntarily chosen to proceed on leave as the bank’s board investigate the allegation of paternity scandal against him. The bank, in a public notice yesterday, said Nuru proceeding on leave would guarantee the sanctity of the investigation.
“We are aware of several stories circulating across several media platforms about our bank’s Managing Director Adam Nuru, a former employee, Mrs Moyo Thomas and her deceased husband, Mr. Tunde Thomas. “While this is a personal matter, the tragedy of the death of Mr. Tunde Thomas and the allegations of unethical conduct require the bank’s board to conduct a review of what transpired, any violations of our code of ethics and the adequacy of this code of ethics. This is already under way. “During the period of the review, the managing director has volunteered to proceed on leave. This will guarantee the sanctity of the review process. We enjoin all our stakeholders to bear with us as we conduct this review and to please respect the various families involved,” the statement said. As at January 3, no fewer than 2,311 people had signed an online petition to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), calling for the sack of Nuru. The petitioners alleged that the bank chieftain was responsible for the demise of Thomas, whose wife he was allegedly in a relationship with. Nuru was also accused of being the father of the couple’s two children. They claimed that Thomas was down with a stroke, as a result of the relationship between his wife and Nuru, but later recovered and thereafter met another lady whom he planned to marry.
He was, however, said to have died two days before his introduction to his already pregnant girlfriend.
