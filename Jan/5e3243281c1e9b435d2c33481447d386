Ibrahim, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), who served as Minister of Transport and Aviation in the military regime of Muhammadu Buhari, was said to have died in an isolation centre in Abuja yesterday. A top government official, who did not want his name mentioned because he was not authorised to speak publicly on the matter ahead of the family, broke the news yesterday. Ibrahim, from Kogi State, served as the AGF of the military regime of General Abdulsalami Abubakar that handed over to the civilian administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999. Prior to his appointment as the AGF, Mr Ibrahim served as the Minister of Education, Science and Technology. Ibrahim is the latest among former and serving top government personalities who lost their lives to COVID-19.
