Suspected kidnappers have demanded N10million ransom for a couple and others they abducted at Uso community in Owo Local Government of Ondo State. The couple was said to be travelling with their three children when they were kidnapped, but their children were left behind. A source said the gunmen locked the doors of the car, after which they took the couple into the forest. The source said it was their underage children who reported the abduction at a nearby police station. Another victim, identified as Johnson, was also kidnapped in the area. It was gathered that policemen, joined by the Ondo Amotekun Corps, were already combing the forest. A suspect, Muhammed Aliu, was said to have been arrested in connection with the abduction. According to the source, “the kidnappers demanded N5million as ransom from the family, but they made a U- turn on Tuesday evening after the family said the N5million was ready and increased it to N10million. “We pleaded with them, but they remained adamant and threatened to kill the young man if we failed to produce N10million ransom within 24 hours.” Command spokesman ASP Tee Leo Ikoro said policemen have been combing the area to ensure the release of the
victims.
