* Text Box: Warns that COVID-19 is real Ace comedian, Atunyota Akpobome, better known as Ali Baba, has said anyone who claims COVID-19 is scam is a “fool”. The award-winning entertainer took to his Instagram page yesterday to share a video wherein he narrated his experience while at the Yaba COVID-19 isolation centre in Lagos after contracting the novel disease. Ali Baba, who revealed that many people died during his time at the isolation centre, called on Nigerians to adhere to the COVID-19 guidelines put in the place by the federal and state governments. He said the need to heed to the protocols became necessary amid a second wave of the pandemic, which he claimed is deadlier than the first. The comedian, who stated that he spent his Christmas and New Year holidays at the isolation centre, also enjoined Nigerians to distance themselves from those who still think that coronavirus pandemic is a scam. “The second wave of COVID-19 is deadlier than the one before. People are dying — pastors, doctors, professors, billionaires, poor men, less privileged… people are dying everyday. Those numbers you see are not fake” he said. “I have spoken with people who attended parties and died two days later. COVID-19 is real, don’t let anyone deceive you. Anyone who tells you COVID-19 is scam, don’t trust the person.” Ali Baba also commended Babajide Sanwo-Olu, governor of Lagos, and medical professionals fighting against the spread of the disease in the state. In a terse accompanying post, the comedian wrote: “Don’t let anyone tell you it’s a scam. I just came out of isolation. Several people died while I was there. Some of my close friends knew and they were very supportive. “COVID is real. Observe all the protocols. People are dying. And it’s not a joke. In fact, anyone who says COVID is a scam is a compound idiot and a fool.”
