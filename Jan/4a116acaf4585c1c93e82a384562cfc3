Manchester City deservedly beat Manchester United 2-0 to reach the Carabao Cup final and will now face Tottenham at Wembley as they look to win the competition for a fourth straight year. Second-half goals from John Stones and Fernandinho secured their progress as City cut loose after a first period in which both sides had chances and goals disallowed. Stones exposed poor United set-piece defending when he nudged home Phil Foden’s free-kick from close range five minutes after the restart. Pep Guardiola’s side looked the more likely scorers afterwards, despite United’s increasing desperation, and when Anthony Martial and Aaron Wan-Bissaka could only combine to clear a corner to the edge of their own box, Fernandinho drilled a first-time volley into the bottom corner from 20 yards. City will equal Liverpool’s record of winning the League Cup four times in a row if they beat Jose Mourinho’s Spurs on Sunday, 25 April. It will be a first final meeting between Guardiola and Mourinho since 2011, when the current Spurs boss’ Real Madrid side denied Barcelona the treble by winning the Copa del Rey.
