The United Kingdom said starting next week, inbound passengers arriving by boat, plane or train would have to take a test up to 72 hours before departing the country they are in and could be denied boarding without this. International arrivals from anywhere in the world, including India, would now be required to prove a negative Covid-19 test taken up to 72 hours prior to departure for the UK, as part of new measures announced on Friday to contain the spread of new variants of coronavirus circulating internationally. Passengers would be subject to an immediate fine of 500 pounds if they fail to comply with the new regulations on pre-departure testing.
Starting next week, inbound passengers arriving by boat, plane or train will have to take a test up to 72 hours before departing the country they are in and could be denied boarding without this. “We already have significant measures in place to prevent imported cases of Covid-19, but with new strains of the virus developing internationally we must take further precautions,” said UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. “Taken together with the existing mandatory self-isolation period for passengers returning from high-risk countries, pre-departure tests will provide a further line of defence – helping us control the virus as we roll out the vaccine at pace over the coming weeks,” he said. Prior to departure, passengers would need to present proof of a negative Covid-19 test result to carriers, as well as fill out a passenger locator form, which was already in force.
