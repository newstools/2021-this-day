Michael Olugbode in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with family, friends, the media, and sporting fraternity over the passing of Eddie Aderinokun. The president, in his condolence message on Monday, signed by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, urged them to strive to keep Aderinokun’s memory alive. Aderinokun, who died on January 3, 2021, aged 80, was a journalist, poet, author and sports administrator. Adesina said the president saluted the more than 60 years of vibrant journalism practice by Aderinokun, which saw him rise to editorship of the then reputable Daily Express Newspaper, and his contribution to literature through many books, particularly on poetry. Buhari, in the statement, was quoted to have said: “Also unforgettable are his footprints in sports development, particularly volleyball, where he made his mark as a very successful Chairman of the Nigerian Volleyball Federation.” He lauded the fact that Aderinokun, as President of Nigeria League of Veteran Journalists, shared his wealth of experience and guided younger professionals on the path of ethics and good conduct, adding that all these would be recorded in his favour by posterity.
