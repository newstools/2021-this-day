By Adedayo Akinwale The All Progressives Congress (APC) has congratulated the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, as he celebrated his 62nd birthday. The National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement issued yesterday described Lawan as a valuable partner-in-progress who is supporting the Committee in its quest to reposition the party. He said, “The APC family celebrates an experienced, cerebral, dexterous and patriotic federal lawmaker who as Chairman of the 9th National Assembly is enshrining a best practice, particularly in legislative-executive relations in Nigeria. In partnering with the executive, the 9th National Assembly under the watch of Dr. Ahmed Lawan has chosen to work for public good and national interest.” Akpanudoedehe noted that Lawan’s collaborative leadership of the 9th National Assembly has achieved and sustained the long-eluded December-January budget cycle in an equally multi-partisan National Assembly, which he said has ensured better national planning. He added, “At party level, Ahmed Lawan is a valuable partner-in-progress who is supporting the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) mandate to reposition our great party and ensure peace, unity and true reconciliation across party ranks. H.E. Ahmed Ibrahim Lawan inputs as member of the tripartite executive/legislative/APC consultative committee has ensured good governance and accelerated implementation of the Next Level Agenda.”
