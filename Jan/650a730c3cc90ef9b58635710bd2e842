By Rebecca Ejifoma Operatives of the Lagos State Police Command last Tuesday arrested two suspected cultists during a gun duel with members of the Aye confraternity at Igbelara, Ikorodu area of the state. Some of the suspects arrested were Waliyu and Timileyin Omobolaji, while others with bullets wounds escaped. According to the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, their arrest is in furtherance of the state police command zeal to decimate cultists in the state. Operatives attached to the Ikorodu Police Division were said to have received a distressed call that some suspected cultists were seen at Igbelara area with dangerous weapons apparently to cause trouble. Adejobi said: “The police, with the help of some community members, rushed to the scene as the deadly gang opened fire on them.” In a swift reaction, Adejobi noted that the operatives responded and engaged the alleged cultists in gun fight, leaving some persons injured as they fled with bullet wounds. “Two of them, Waliyu and Timileyin Omobolaji, were eventually arrested with wounds while one cut-to-size pistol, 10 expended cartridges and six live cartridges were recovered from them. “Those injured have been taken to hospital for medical attention,” he disclosed. Meanwhile, the state Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has appealed to the public, especially medical practitioners, to alert the police whenever they come across any of the fleeing suspected cultists with bullet wounds. The state police boss also commended the police and the public for their courage and commitment to tackling the criminals who have been terrorising the Ikorodu area. Odumosu, therefore, ordered that the matter be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) at Panti, Yaba, for discreet Investigation.
