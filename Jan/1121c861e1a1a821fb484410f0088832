In ancient times January 6 was the biblical epiphany, a revelation or realization, when the wise men arrived at the stable. Now January 6 will be remembered as the day America realised that the Presidentâ€™s words can inspire people to storm the Capital as an act of terrorism, not patriotism. There were no wise people this time. Dennis Fitzgerald,
