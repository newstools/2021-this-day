By Kayode Fasua Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has called on judges to dispense justice without fear or favour and tread the path of honour while discharging their duties in line with their oath of office. The governor who made the call at the swearing-in of Justice Olatunde Opeyemi Sobowale, as a Judge of the State High Court, at the Governor’s Office Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, said as dispensers of justice, they must judge accordingly without considering ethnic, religious status or political affiliations of parties involved. “We, therefore, expect that at every point in time, you are faithful to the oath of your office. You must dispense justice without fear or favour, and then tread on the part of honour and pride that has been established by the forebears of Ogun State. “It is my belief that, with today’s swearing-in, the tradition of integrity, diligence, industry and excellence that had been the feat of our state’s judiciary will not only be continued but also improved,” he said. He noted that as a responsive and responsible administration that appreciate the place of the judiciary in entrenching best ideals and practice of democracy. He said good governance was characterised with the availability of men and women of proven integrity to coordinate affairs of the state, assuring that it would continue to ensure equitable dispensation and efficient administration of justice in Ogun State.
