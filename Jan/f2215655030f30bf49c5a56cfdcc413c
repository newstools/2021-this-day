It is a fact that Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, a former governor of Abia State, has, at different times, suffered undeserved humiliation in the nation’s political space. But like a true fighter, he has always triumphed over his adversaries. Perhaps, this explains why he has become a reference point and a colossus of some sort in politics in Nigeria. On Sunday, December 27, 2020, the chief whip of the Senate showcased his high network when he pulled powerful government officials, top politicians, business moguls, and captains of industries to his country home at Igbere, Abia State for the 10 years’ remembrance of his late father, Chief Johnson Uzor Nesiegbe Kalu.
