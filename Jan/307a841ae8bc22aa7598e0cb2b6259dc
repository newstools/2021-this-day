By Francis Sardauna Youths in Katsina State, under the auspices of Katsina State Youth Democratic Forum, have called for the immediate dissolution of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) caretaker committees at ward, local and state levels in the state. The Chairman of the Forum, Shamsudeen Sale, who made the call at a press conference on Wednesday, said the retention of the outgoing executive members as caretakers of the party in the state is unacceptable in a democratic era. He said: “The action of APC Katsina State of retaining outgoing executive members is unacceptable in the democratic process which will not only affect intra-party politics, but will equally cause confusion in the state democratic process. “We call for the immediate dissolution of the caretakers of APC and youth should fully form the structure at all levels.” While decrying what he termed negligence of the youths in political cycle by Governor Aminu Bello Masari-led administration, Sale said he would mobilise members of the Forum to vote only candidates that will carry youths along in the next general election. He, however, described the suspension of Muttaqa Rabe Darma from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state as undemocratic, saying the suspension will cause confusion and create division in the opposition party. He insisted that the suspension of the PDP stalwart would paralyse political activities in the state and endanger members’ right to elect good leaders in the forthcoming general election. “The recent so-called suspension of Muttaqa Rabe Darma will not only create chaos in PDP, but will endanger the citizens’ right to elect good leaders in the next coming election which will equally paralyse political activities in the state,” he said.
