By Deji Elumoye President Muhammadu Buhari has canvassed for improved fire safety standards to forestall frequency of fire disasters across the country. He made the call Wednesday while expressing sympathy and solidarity with victims of the recent Sokoto Central Market fire incident. In a statement issued by his media assistant, Garba Shehu, the president, while directing federal aid agencies to respond to the urgent needs of the victims of the disaster, called on market authorities to train traders and facility managers on basic safety precautions to forestall frequency of fire outbreaks. According to him, “Once the traders are trained on the risk factors, it will go a long way to minimize the frequency of fire outbreaks at business places. “I am deeply moved by this fire incident because of its huge adverse impact on the economic life of the people who struggle daily to earn a living. “To see your investments go up in flames is particularly painful and I sincerely send my heartfelt sympathy and solidarity with all the victims, and pray to God to replenish your losses.’’
