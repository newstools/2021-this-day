*Assures Nigerians of full implementation of 2021 budget Deji Elumoye in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday declared that his administration’s books will always be open for public scrutiny, stressing that his government has nothing to hide.
Buhari, according to a release by his Media Assistant, Garba Shehu, made this disclosure in Daura after revalidating his membership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The statement said Buhari also assured Nigerians of full implementation of the 2021 budget, with all transparency and openness in meeting the targets, while appreciating the National Assembly for the effective and detailed attention before the passage. The President said the budget aptly captured some of the visions of the administration, and all efforts will be poured in to ensure effective implementation. His words: “We have directed all the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to follow what is in the budget so that we can get the National Assembly to easily support the next budget. We can tell them what we have received, and how it was spent. “We are always ready to make the balance sheet available for all Nigerians and the National Assembly. We have nothing to hide.’’ Buhari said the administration had given more attention to agriculture in order to diversify and strengthen the economy and thanked Morocco for supporting Nigeria’s move to produce fertiliser in the country. He said: “We are still grateful to Morocco for the support they gave us in producing fertilizer in the country. We have 42 companies producing fertiliser in six geopolitical zones.’’
