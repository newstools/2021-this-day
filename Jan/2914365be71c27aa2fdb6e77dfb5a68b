By Laleye Dipo A former governor of Niger State, Muazu Babangida Aliyu, has told the Peoples Democratic Party ((PDP) faithful across the country to immediately start preparing for the 2023 general election else the train will leave them behind. “The build up for the next general election starts now. We must all resolve to redeem PDP now or risk being confined to the dustbins of history,” Aliyu said in a New Year message to supporters of the party. In the message, which he personally signed and made available to THISDAY on Friday, the former governor said the PDP lost the 2015 and 2019 elections as a result of indiscipline. “The PDP lost elections in 2015 and 2019 because of the non-commitment of some of our members and due to the indiscipline of some interest blocs within the party. “As the leader of our great party in Niger State, I seek to encourage all of us to remain committed, resilient and unwaveringly resolute to work as a team and return PDP to power at both the centre and in Niger State. “You must all know your rights. Stop being beggarly. Don’t sell your votes and your future to political hawks. Nigeria can only get better if we all insist on making it so,” the former governor said. He added that: “All of us, men and women, especially our youth, must shun greed, indiscipline, lack of commitment, respect and love for the party and as well shun lust for money. “2020 was indeed a year of great hardships, pains, turmoils and tribulations, but in all, we must appreciate Allah’s mercies and the enablement He granted us to scale through.” Aliyu prayed for the repose of the souls of all those who lost their lives in the past year and prayed God to grant them eternal rest and their families the strength to shoulder the losses.
