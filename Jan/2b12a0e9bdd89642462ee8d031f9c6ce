Fadekemi Ajakaiye The Association of African Startups, TAAS, recommends entrepreneurship as essential for economic growth in Nigeria. This was stated at the inaugural launch of TAAS learning hub in Lagos, recently. The President, TAAS, Ms. Just Ibe stated that the goal of the organisation is to build a strong network of entrepreneurs within the African space who are focused on building sustainable businesses and are in for the long haul. TAAS is an African-centred organisation focused on people, performance and the creation of sustainable businesses in the economic space, she said. “Our mission is to equip African Startups with tools, strategies and requisite knowledge to attract local and global opportunities while building a platform to facilitate strategic partnership and collaboration with Government, investors and the private sector,” she said. Ibe stated that TAAS has access to global opportunities through strategic partnerships which would enable a diverse and vibrant African economy. “We have set up a tailored framework to aid the learning curriculum, in our boot camp. Also, we have instructors from the 55 countries in Africa,” she said. The CEO, TAAS, Ms. Omayemi Sage stated that the African continent has been a victim of exploitation for so long, coupled with our increasing population, which calls for attention and the need to create sustainable businesses. She said, “Through our unique approach of providing strategic insight that is tailored to the needs of each individual, we fully prepare African entrepreneurs with the tools needed to compete locally but on a global scale.” TAAS Learning Hub is designed to uplift start-ups on the continent with the 21st century business technique and approach which activates results and guarantees their path to success, she stated. “We intend to nurture and grow the entrepreneurial DNA of startups in Africa who will advance the growth of a vibrant and sustainable African economy,” she said.
