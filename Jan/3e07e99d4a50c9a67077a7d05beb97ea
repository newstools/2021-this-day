David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka A governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)in Anambra State, Mr. Godwin Ezeemo, has said that job creation, especially among the youths could totally eliminate crime in the state. The industrialist and businessman-turned politician who spoke with journalists yesterday said he was in the Anambra governorship race to ensure provision of employment and rebuilding of the state’s economy. He said, “Curbing crime and bringing about quality security can only be achieved through job creation. The youths must be engaged properly. An idle mind remains a threat to the security of the society. “The continuous increase in the population of young and vibrant men and women, graduates and skilled youths roaming the street all in attempt to survive is no longer acceptable. It is a threat to the security of lives and property.” The aspirant stated that he is not promising what he has not previously done as a personal individual, insisting that his chains of companies have provided over 20,000 direct and indirect jobs. Ezeemo listed his business interest to include Orient farms, fresh life water, Orient Newspaper and Orient printing press, and many others.
“I believe I have the capacity and technical know-how to bring about greater chances and massive employment for the youths if given the mandate as the governor of Anambra State,” he stated.
