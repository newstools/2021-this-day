Bruno Fernandes’ superb 78th-minute free-kick gave Manchester United 3-2 victory in a thrilling FA Cup tie with old rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford. Liverpool led a fantastic contest through Mohamed Salah, who then equalised after Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford had struck for the hosts either side of the break. But in a game which had everything last week’s drab stalemate between this pair at Anfield lacked, Fernandes came off the bench to have the final word after Fabinho had fouled Edinson Cavani on the edge of the area. Fernandes might have been slightly off the pace in recent games but when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer needed his £47m inspiration to come up with another special moment, the Portuguese delivered, bending his shot round the wall and beyond Allison’s reach. The victory earns United a home meeting with an in-form West Ham side managed by former boss David Moyes in the fifth round. But the search for form goes on for Liverpool, whose only win in seven games since that seven-goal hammering of Crystal Palace came against Aston Villa’s kids in the last round, and who have a meeting with Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham looming on Thursday. It was not quite the ending Solskjaer served up when he won a previous fourth-round meeting between these sides but, as in 1999, they had to come from behind. And while Fernandes applied the devastating finish, that goal should not be allowed to overshadow Rashford’s contribution to United’s victory. So much has been said about the England forward as a social crusader it is sometimes easy to forget he also needs to be judged as a footballer. At only 23, he is still a long way off his prime but he is developing into an outstanding forward, with vision to match his speed and finishing ability.
