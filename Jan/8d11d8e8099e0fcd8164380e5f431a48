By Ibrahim Shuaibu Ahead of the upcoming local government election slated for January 16, 2021, the Chairman of Kano State Independent Electoral Commission (KANSIEC), Professor Garba Ibrahim Sheka, has likened elections in the state to war. Sheka made the statement yesterday at the opening of a one-day training for Civil Society Election Observers of the 2021 local government elections, which was held at Mambayya House in the state. According to him, election in Kano State requires adequate security “because it’s always like the world is coming to an end.” The KANSIEC chairman said he witnessed elections in Kogi, Gombe and Borno States, where they were conducted peacefully, and people moved around as if there was no election taking place. However, Sheka stated that: “but in Kano State, elections are always rowdy. It is always like the world is coming to an end during election.” The chairman, however, stated that part of the preparation for the Saturday’s election was a prayer to Almighty God to make the exercise peaceful and violence-free. He disclosed that election materials, both sensitive and non-sensitive, are ready, adding that the non-sensitive ones are already being distributed to various local government areas. Sheka added that the election body had delayed the distribution of sensitive materials till Friday, adding that adequate security had been provided to accompany the materials to their various destinations. He further stated that all security agencies had promised to give maximum cooperation during the exercise, disclosing that the police AIG in Zone 1 had pledged to deploy additional police officers to provide security during the election.
