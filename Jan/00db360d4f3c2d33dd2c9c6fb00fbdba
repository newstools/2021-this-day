To add a sparkle to an unusual Christmas celebration caused by the ravaging coronavirus, MTN Nigeria sponsored ‘Oluronbi’, a musical theatre performance by Bolanle Austen-Peters Productions (BAP). An ancient Yoruba folktale, the musical follows the life of Oluronbi, a woman who promised to dedicate her first child as offering to the spirits who cured her barrenness. It featured eight performances in four days at Terra Kulture in Victoria Island, Lagos. Speaking at the premiere, producer of the play Austen-Peters spoke on the future of BAP: “We are going to bring you stories that are authentically Nigerian.” She also expressed gratitude to MTN for its contribution at a critical time like this. Executive Secretary MTN Foundation Nonny Ugboma added that: “At MTN, we value arts and culture. This is why we are always willing to support its celebration. We are also keen on ensuring that talented Nigerians have platforms to tell important stories that resonate around who we are. We are honoured to be part of this beautiful retelling of the story of Oluronbi. We are also glad that we were able to make lives a little brighter by collaborating with BAP.”
