Jon Jones has poked fun at UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya after it was suggested that Bones left the light heavyweight division to dodge fights. Jones vacated the light heavyweight championship last year having enjoyed a near decade of domination in the division. The 33-year-old has moved up to the heavyweight division yet that hasn’t stopped critics from suggesting that he did so only to avoid Adesanya or Dominick Reyes in a rematch. Jones responded in hilarious fashion on Twitter, adding tongue-in-cheek that he moved to the heavyweight division ‘out of fear’. He tweeted: ‘I didn’t leave the light heavyweight division to challenge myself, I ran out of fear.’ Jones also had his say on UFC chief Dana White pairing Adesanya against Jan Blachowicz, who beat Reyes for the vacant light heavyweight title. It represents a move up in weight class for Adesanya, who White still wants Jones to face in the Octagon. Jones mocked Adesanya for moving up to a weight division that he is no longer in, suggesting that the middleweight champion only went up a class when he left. Jones added: “When I move, you move, just like that. Name another fighter who’s made more men retire, switch weight classes, or switch organisations all together. I’ll wait.”
