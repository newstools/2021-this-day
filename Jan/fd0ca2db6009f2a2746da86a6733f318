He was appointed to lead the offensive against Boko Haram in the North-East in May 2017. He was however redeployed by the then Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai, after a string of attacks by the insurgents, and after he was given a deadline in July to deliver Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau dead or alive within 40 days. But Attahiru claimed in his valedictory speech as Theatre Commander that his removal was routine and not as a result of failure to realise his mandate. “Permit me to seize this opportunity to clear the air on certain insinuations that had arisen following my posting. May I point out here that such insinuations being touted by a cross section of the media are far from the truth, misleading and capable of eroding the successes so far achieved in the fight against insurgency in the North East. “It could also send a wrong signal and precipitate disaffection among troops of the Nigerian Army and indeed the Theatre of operation. My redeployment to Army Headquarters is a routine posting premised on needs assessment and is a normal exercise in the Nigerian Army. It is a call to higher responsibility and I assure you of my resolve to serve the Nigerian Army and the nation even better in that new capacity.
