Former presidential candidate, Adamu Garba, says it makes no sense for cows to be roaming the streets in any part of Nigeria in 2021. He said this in a series of tweets on the development in Oyo and Ondo States over the activities of herdsmen on Sunday The presidential candidate suggested that herdsmen should be enlightened on the laws governing land ownership, urging the northern elite to establish ranches in the region. He tweeted, “I’m a Fulani man, but I can tell you that it doesn’t make sense for cows to be roaming the streets in 2021. “Cows should be ranched on land acquired or rented by the ranchers. By law, land can only be used through rent or purchase. “Government should step forward and clear this out. “I believe, to reconcile the raging herders crisis is to open proper communication where each knows the laws of the land. “All lands in Nigeria, including forests belong to some entity, federal government, state governments, local governments, company’s or individuals. “Thus, no land can be used without proper authorisation. “The problem of the Fulani herders is a betrayal from the city Fulanis, who decided, after moving to cities, acquiring wealth and power, but forget to carry the village brothers along, leaving them in a desperate situation. “The rich Fulanis must come together and get ranching lands. “Land issue is as old as humanity, no any state power can give land to anyone where the land is been identified with owners for generations, without purchasing or renting. “The rich Fulani must come together and assist our fellow brothers to get ranching land or forest for grazing. “Lack of proper communication to the herders in understanding the law of land use, by bringing the surrounding communities onboard isn’t good enough. “It may well be a breeding ground for cyclical conflicts, a very ripe situation for civil war. “This must be avoided AT ALL COST.”
