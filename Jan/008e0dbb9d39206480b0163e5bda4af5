By John Shiklam The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has commended the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) for its operations along the dreaded Kaduna-Abuja road where bandits kill and abduct travellers for ransom almost on a daily basis. In a statement on Sunday in Kaduna, the Chairman of ACF and former minister of agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbe,
called on other security forces to emulate the good example of the NAF and take the fight to the doorsteps of the insurgents, bandits and other criminal elements terrorising Nigerians. Ogbe commended NAF for the successful operation along the Abuja- Kaduna road last week, which, according to him, led to the killing of about 50 bandits. “I wish to, on behalf of Arewa Consultative Forum, congratulate President, Commander in Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces, Muhammadu Buhari, and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, for the successful operation on Abuja-Kaduna road last week in which about 50 bandits were neutralized,” Ogbe said. He lamented that the bandits have for some time now taken control of the Abuja-Kaduna road and made life unbearable for innocent travellers, noting that many of them have been robbed, killed or kidnapped for ransom. “It is indeed heartwarming to hear that they have been dealt a heavy blow by our gallant forces. “The Arewa Consultative Forum calls on the other security forces — Army, Police, Navy, DSS — to borrow from the good example of the Air Force and take the fight to the doorsteps of the insurgents, bandits and other criminal elements that are making life very unbearable for law abiding citizens in Nigeria. “The Arewa Consultative Forum assures the president and his security forces that we do not only criticize them when they go wrong but are willing and will commend them when they do the right thing. “We pray that God will give them the strength and wisdom to secure Nigeria in 2021 and the years ahead,” Ogbe said.
