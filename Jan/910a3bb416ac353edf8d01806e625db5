Like the true father figure he is, NapoliHead Coach, Gennaro Gattuso, has said that he will meet with Super Eagles forward, Victor Osimhen, after the Nigerian apologised for breaching coronavirus protocols at a party organised in Lagos during the festive period in December. The AFCON 2019 bronze medal winner with Nigeria is yet to return to action since Super Eagles’ 4-4 home draw against Sierra Leone in an AFCON 2022 qualifier at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin. Osimhen dislocated his shoulder to stay away from football in the last two months. Recuperating Osimhen picked the coronavirus at a party to celebrate his 22nd birthday on December 29. But after Napoli’s 4-1 win over Cagliari on Sunday, Gattuso gave his opinion on the situation. “He’s a young lad who gives his all in training,” the Italian manager told the club website. “He knows he’s made a mistake and he’s apologised. “I’ll speak to him. I know how much he wants to get back onto the right track and get back playing.” Osimhen, on his part, issued an apology to the club and his teammates for his ‘wrong’ decision which has delayed his return to training because of the compulsory two weeks he will spend in isolation. “I am so sorry for what happened, I was wrong to go to Nigeria at this moment, even if I have many loved ones over there, including my brothers,” Osimhen wrote on his Instagram story. “I was wrong to take part in the party. I didn’t understand the severity of what I was doing. I apologise to the club, the coach, the team and the fans.” The Nigeria forward completed a big-money move to Napoli in August after an outstanding 2019-20 campaign in the French Ligue 1 with Lille. He has scored two goals so far in six Serie A matches for Napoli who sit fourth in the league table with 28 points from 14 matches.
