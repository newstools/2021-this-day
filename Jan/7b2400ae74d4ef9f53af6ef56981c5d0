The Lagos State Government has directed that all public and private schools below tertiary level in the state should be reopened for the second term 2020/21 academic session from January 18, 2021. The Commissioner for Education, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo, who made known in a statement made available to THISDAY, said this is in line with the federal government’s directive, coupled with the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. She appealed to all schools to make efforts to comply with all the outlined COVID-19 requirements for resumption of schools.
“Not just for the improvement of overall school operations, but for the safe reopening of academic activities to support the Lagos State Government’s quest for a full return.” The commissioner said schools should have flexible plans where students and teachers who feel sick can teach or learn from home via available online platforms, adding that they should also strive to avoid any COVID-19 infection among all students and staff. She enjoined teachers, students and visitors to wear facemasks at all times, observe physical distancing, embrace regular hand washing with soap under running water and maintain a high standard of personal hygiene within the school premises.
