Naturally, one of the things that give parents great satisfaction in life is to see their children excel in life.
For Dr. Mike Adenuga, Chairman, Globacom Nigeria, there is no gainsaying the fact that he feels a sense of fulfilment, particularly as his beautiful daughter, Bella Disu, keeps soaring higher in life. When you meet brainy Disu, you are likely to come up with a lot of conjectures. This is because her impressive career growth and achievements do not betray her age. A few days ago, Disu was appointed as the chairman of the board of directors of Abumet Nigeria, effective January 1, 2021. The firm, a subsidiary of Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, is a leading solutions provider for the planning, processing, and installation of aluminium and glass products, from single standard windows to sophisticated facades and large-scale design masterpieces. Disu, who holds a Bachelor of Arts in International Relations from the University of Massachusetts and a Master of Science in Leadership from the Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts USA, replaces Alhaji Bamanga Tukur, who recently resigned from the board. Bella, also a member of the Chartered Institute of Management of Nigeria (MNIM) and the Institute of Directors of Nigeria (MIOD), is currently the executive vice-chairman of Globacom Limited, Chief Executive Officer of Cobblestone Properties & Estates Limited, a Director on the Board of Mike Adenuga Centre and a Director on the board of Julius Berger Nigeria plc.
