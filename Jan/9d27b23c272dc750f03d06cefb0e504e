*Okagbue targets top-six finish for FC IfeanyiUbah By Duro Ikhazuagbe Nyima Nwagua’s 19th minute goal earned Kano Pillars maximum points in their rescheduled midweek clash with Rivers United FC at the Ahmadu Ballo Stadium in Kaduna. The win lifts the Sai Masu Gida to the fifth spot of the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) while Rivers United who were hoping for a win to return to the top of the log remain at second spot two points behind leaders Nasarawa United. Meanwhile, FC Ifeanyiubah who have had their worst ever start to the NPFL season with just one win after six matches remain desperate to finish the 2020-21 season in the top six. Head Coach of the Anambra Warriors, Uche Okagbue, believes FC IfeanyiUbah are still capable of finishing the season in the top six as long as they improve on their away results. The Nnewi-based club currently sit 18th on the league standings, two points from safety after six rounds of matches. The team have lost in all their last 15 away matches – a run currently bettered only by Adamawa United’s 24-games losing streak on the road. Speaking after Sunday’s1-0 defeat at Kwara United, Okagbue acknowledged the team’s need to improve their away performance, “this is a matter of picking points away and we will do it,” he said. “We are going to end the season amongst the top six. When you have players, you have to give them confidence to play and make them believe they can do it and they will do it before the season ends,” he concluded. FC Ifeanyiubah will next host Wikki Tourists for one of Matchday 7 fixturea in the 2020/21 NPFL season this weekend.
