Fayemi in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, in Ado-Ekiti yesterday, said the news of Professor Ibidapo-Obe’s death was received with shock and disbelief since the late vice chancellor did not exhibit any sign of illness during their last meeting. The governor who is an alumnus of the University of Lagos, described the late Ibidapo-Obe as a distinguished scholar and seasoned administrator, who excelled in every assignment he undertook, adding that he demonstrated his commitment to excellence during his stint as the vice chancellor of the University between 2000 and 2007.

Fayemi stated that the footprints of the deceased remain indelible in the annals of Nigerian history, adding that he would be sorely missed for his brilliant contributions to the field of engineering and nation building. “Prof Ibidapo-Obe’s transition is sudden and shocking. He was highly meticulous and highly cerebral. We shall miss his brilliance, candour and unique touch of excellence. “Another great scholar, indeed, a great Nigerian has departed. While we shall all miss Prof Ibidapo-Obe, we are comforted with the fact that he lived a good life and left a legacy of honour and excellent service to fatherland. “Our prayer is that God will grant the family of the deceased the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss,” he added
