Barely four weeks into 2021, Wesco Lotto and Bet boss, Wale Osinubi, has begun to revel in celebrations.
The popular Lotto merchant kicked off the year on a great note, when he first celebrated his birthday, and then, a few days after, the amiable businessman welcomed a bundle of joy. In celebration of the memorable day, a modest bash with COVID-19 protocols duly enforced was organised. Also, he held a low-key but classy naming ceremony for his new bundle of joy from his adorable wife, Mariam. As always, he was joined in the double celebration by his friends and family members.
