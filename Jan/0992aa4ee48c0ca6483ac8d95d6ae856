The commissioner, however said, troops under “Operation Thunder Strike” have continued with fight against banditry in the state. “Troops under the auspices of Operation Thunder Strike have continued fighting patrols in Gwagwada general area of Chikun Local Government Area, which connects with the Kaduna-Abuja highway,” he said. According to Aruwan, “an operational feedback to the Kaduna State Government revealed that the troops conducted clearance patrols to Napayako and Dajin Wuya, during which several bandit camps were destroyed.” He said, “The patrol followed an earlier attack by bandits on hunters in the forest, when two hunters were left with gunshot wounds. “During the clearance operation, the troops mobilised to the location with some hunters who escaped the prior attack. “While the camps were dislodged, one of the wounded hunters, Yohanna Yakubu, was found. The other hunter, Isuwa Tanko, was eventually confirmed dead.” The commissioner said in another “sad development, armed bandits attacked Garu village of Igabi Local Government Area in the early hours of today (Wednesday), killing two locals – Aliyu Daiyabu and Safiyanu Muhammad”. He said Governor Nasir El-Rufai had sent his condolences to the families of those killed and prayed for the repose of their souls.
