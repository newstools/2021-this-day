Turkish Super Lig giants Galatasaray have decided to loan out Jesse Sekidika, 24, following the arrival of Henry Onyekuru at the club in the January transfer window, which pushed him further down the pecking order of wingers. Sekidika has joined another Turkish top-flight club İttifak Holding Konyaspor for the remainder of the 2020-2021 season. Since his move to the Lions last January, he has found game time difficult to come by, making only three starts from a possible 46 in all competitions. Konyaspor General Manager Seçkin özdil attended the signing ceremony held at the MEDAŞ Konya Metropolitan Stadium Press Meeting Hall yesterday. Speaking after signing the loan deal, Sekidika told the club’s official website: “Thank you for giving me this opportunity. Much obliged. I know the size of Konyaspor and what kind of a community it is. I’ll do my best here. Thank you for everything. “From the first moment I came to the club, I came across many beautiful things. They made a very nice welcome, everyone was very friendly. I even called my wife, we talked to her. “When we came to the stadium, Konyaspor Club gave a gift that I will never forget. My wife was also very happy with this situation. “Of course, I will pay you for these during the season. I hope we will all be happy together”. Sekidika has been handed the number 71 jersey at Konyaspor for the remainder of this season.
