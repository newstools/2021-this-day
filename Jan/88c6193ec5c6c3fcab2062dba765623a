Adibe Emenyonu in Benin-city Gunmen yesterday shot Mr. ThankGod Iduseri, the younger brother to a chieftain of the Edo State All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Gabriel Iduseri, in Benin-city. ThankGod was said to have been shot in Benin-city, the state capital, in the early hours of yesterday while driving on Mission Road when his assailants shot him and made away with his car. Although there may be no link or correlation between the incident and the appearance of Gabriel Iduseri at the Federal High Court last Monday as witness, ‘but the APC is already thinking towards that direction’. Confirming the incident on a phone call yesterday, Gabriel, an engineer by profession, and the APC South-south Zonal Youth leader, said: My brother, ThankGod was shot in the early hours of this (yesterday) morning between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. on Mission Road. “He left home for Globacom office in one of my vehicles, and that was when they just opened the car door, shot at him and pushed him out of the car and went away with the vehicle. But we thank God he is responding to treatment, and the incident has been reported at the police station in the city.” Also, in his reaction, the state Chairman of the caretaker committee of the APC, Col David Imuse (rtd), said: “Gabriel Iduseri, who is one of our witnesses, and had testified at the Federal High Court in Abuja yesterday (Monday) over a case of forgery and perjury preferred against the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki, had his brother, Mr. ThankGod, shot this (yesterday) morning. This is quite unfortunate. “I think there’s absolutely no place in the marketplace of ideas for threats of violence against any person, especially those with divergent political belief.” Imuse added that: “Disagreement on political issues should not lead to acts of violence. We call on Nigerians to roundly condemn this dastardly act, and urge the security agencies to bring the perpetrators to book.”
