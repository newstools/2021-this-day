Former President Olusegun Obasanjo, yesterday, described the late billionaire businessman, Chief Bolu Akin-Olugbade, as passionate in his defence of Nigerian unity. In a condolence letter addressed to his wife, Mrs. Oladunni Akin-Olugbade, the former president said the deceased was also devoted to his roots. Obasanjo remarked that Bolu would be greatly missed by his community, local government area, state, and the nation in general, lamenting that all Owu people have lost a great son. The former President is the Balogun (Prime Minister) of Owu, where the late billionaire hails from. Obasanjo in the letter issued by his Special Assistant on Media, Mr. Kehinde Akinyemi, said in spite of his privileged background, Bolu did not lose the common touch. The former president said, “He was as passionate in his defence of Nigerian unity as he was devoted to his roots. “No wonder, he actively promoted the history and culture of his local community who also immensely benefited from his wise counsel and generosity. “As Aare Ona Kakanfo and a prominent son of Owu Kingdom, our much-respected brother contributed to better understanding and harmony among our people. “He was a committed and effective representative of his people and worked for their progress. His unfaltering support for the general interest of Owu Kingdom and its Chiefs-in-Council cannot be over-emphasised. He was loyal, devoted, dedicated, and faithful generally to Owu cause and interest. “As the Chair of Owu Empowerment Committee, he gave in cash and kind. Bolu will be greatly missed by his community, Local Government Area, State, and the nation in general. All Owu people have lost a great son. “Given Bolu’s pedigree, it is not surprising that the life of his brilliance as a lawyer began to show itself right from his days at the University of London, University of California (Los Angeles), and Cambridge University
