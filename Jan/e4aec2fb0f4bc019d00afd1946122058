By Udora Orizu The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has paid a condolence visit to the Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Nuhu Ahmed Bamalli, over the death of two prominent princes in the emirate. The two princes — Alhaji Bashir Aminu (the Iyan Zazzau) and the Talban Zazzau, Abdulkadir Iya-Pate, died Friday. Gbajabiamila, who visited the emir’s palace in Zaria, Kaduna State, on Saturday, with a delegation of over 20 members of the House, including the House Leader, Hon. Alhassan Ado Doguwa, offered his sympathies to the Emirate Council and the immediate families of the deceased. He also prayed to God to grant the souls of the late princes eternal rest. The Speaker, while commiserating with the emirate council, also congratulated Bamalli over his elevation to the throne. Gbajabiamila said: “I was here with my heart, with my soul. The only thing that was not here on that day was my body. May you grow over us your subjects, and that includes myself, with wisdom and with fatherly love. “Having said that, it is ironic that at the same time, I am coming to offer commiseration on the loss of two prominent members of your council. I only heard yesterday, then I was given the details this morning. What can we say? May Allah grant them eternal rest. May their souls rest in peace.” He thanked the royal father for his support for the House of Representatives, particularly the ninth Assembly and prayed that God would continue to guide him. Responding, the emir thanked the Speaker for the visit. He said the entire emirate was in shock over the death of the two princes, though they submitted to the will of God.
