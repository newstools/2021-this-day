By Okon Bassey The Akwa Ibom State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Chairman, Mr. Udo Ekpenyong, is dead. Sources said the deceased PDP state leader died in the early hours of yesterday.

Ekpenyong, before his election as the state chairman of the PDP, was a former state commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs. By the time of filling in this report, officials of the party and family members were said to be in crucial meeting over the incident. However, the family, party and the state government are yet to issue an official statement over the tragedy. The state Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr. Borono Bassey, didn’t answer his phone calls to comment on the development.
