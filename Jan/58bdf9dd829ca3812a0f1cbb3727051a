The Management of Abia Warriors Football Club of Umuahia has given the Technical Crew of the team the mandate to win their next three matches in the Nigerian topflight NPFL or get fired. Spokesman of the Abia State owned club, Nwosu Chigozie, the ultimatum came after Management held an emergency meeting with the coaches at the Club’s Secretariat in Umuahia following the dismal performance of the team in the on-going Nigeria Professional Football League where Abia Warriors have lost their first four league games. “The Management reiterated that the team has no reason not to do well considering the calibre of players in the squad,” pointing out that the “technical crew, led by Imama Amapakabo has enjoyed the greatest support and cooperation ever given to any crew in the Club’s history.”
