Sylvester Idowu in Warri A Chieftain of the people’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta State, Chief Sunny Onuesoke has described the statement credited to the leader of the Northern Elder’s Forum, Professor Ango Abdullahi that the North is ready for restructuring as brave and a welcome development. Onuesoke, also an advocate of restructuring of the country, lauded the new position of Professor Abdullahi while speaking to newsmen yesterday at his country home in Agbarha-Otor in Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State.
Professor Abdullahi, a former Vice-Chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria and Convener of Northern Elders Forum (NEF) had in an interview with a national newspaper recently disclosed that the North is ready for restructuring of the country to make it more viable. Reacting to Professor Abdullahi’s position, Onuesoke said that the position of the North to embrace the clamour for restructuring will now allay the fears of other zones and hasten the development of the country. “Every right thinking Nigerian would agree to the simple fact that the current political, social and economic structure has failed the nation and can no longer sustain our current political cleavages, hence him coming out to say the north is ready for restructuring is such a brave statement and welcome development going forward being mouthpiece of the Northern Elders Forum. “The debate about restructuring is a stark reality staring us in the face and trying to shift discussion from it is like postponing the evil days, judging from the current social-economic uncertainty which has befallen our nation today,” he said.
The former governorship aspirant in Delta State noted that the reality on ground today should be a serious cause for concern to every patriotic Nigerian hence the continuous clamour for restructuring from every corners of the country. “The clamour for restructuring has gone beyond just one tribe or region, it has become a national agitation because a restructured Nigeria would mean a paradigm shift where every state, zone or region would be able look inward and explore it’s competitive advantage with a view of developing a virile, stable and self-sustaining social economic framework for the betterment of their people,” he stated.
