Konga has commenced new sales campaign. The campaign is to cover 65,000 mobile phones, 15,000 laptops/desktops/printers, 3,150 inverters and inverter batteries, 1550 TVs, loads of Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), as well as home and kitchen items of assorted brands and configurations. The items are up for grabs in the firm’s first major sales campaign for 2021 tagged, ‘January Clearance Sale.’ The campaign which commenced on Monday this week, will run till the end of the month.
One of the features of the clearance sale is the opportunity it affords individuals to shop online or from any of Konga’s retail stores nationwide while bulk buyers can also enjoy further reduced prices on Konga Bulk. Konga made a commitment last year to support Nigerians embracing online learning and working from home as a way out of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially with the current scarcity of digital devices hitting consumers with higher prices. The company’s Vice President, Retail, Eric Nana said the campaign, “provides a chance for parents, returning students and educational institutions to shop essential items, as the school sessions resume nationwide. Also, it offers businesses and corporate organizations a less expensive and reliable means of replenishing or replacing official tools, devices, gadgets in record time,’’ Nana said.
