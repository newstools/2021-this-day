By Okon Bassey The police in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State capital, have arrested two fraudsters over fake bank alert and a stolen vehicle. The police in a statement issued yesterday, signed by the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Odiko MacDon, said the two fraudsters were nabbed in different operations carried out by the state police command. He explained that the police command on January 18, 2021, relying on credible information that a Lexus 330 car was bought with fake bank alert at Festac Town in Lagos State, trailed the car to Uyo through Abia State. MacDon said in a coordinated operation, and utilising the instruments of intelligence-driven policing by the Anti- Cultism Unit of the police command, arrested one Emeka John Akuma of Abia State. The fraudster, Akuma, the police said, was arrested on IBB Road by Ibom Hall in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital. The state police revealed that Akuma was arrested while driving the car with a fake number plate: Lagos AKD 230 GQ, and the vehicle was recovered. Also, the PPRO said on January 17, 2021, operatives of the same unit apprehended a Point-of-Sale (POS) operator, Moses James Asuquo, 26. He said Asuquo was arrested for fraudulently using fake alert to defraud Markson Mark Wisdom and Edidiong Samuel Robert of the sum of N200,000 at his POS stand at Udoudoma Avenue in Uyo. The state Commissioner of Police, Amiengheme Andrew, drew the attention of members of the public to the prevalence of these crimes in the state. He equally urged the citizens to take additional steps in securing their cars by inserting security devices in them, and be more vigilant after parking their cars as the police command is inundated of stolen cars.
