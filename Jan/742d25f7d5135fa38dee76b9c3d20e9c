by Bennett Oghifo Mikano Motors, a subsidiary of Mikano International Limited recently undertook a test-drive of Geely Emigrand 7 (Sedan) and Geely X7 Sports (SUV) assembled in Nigeria. With Nigerian motoring journalists on board, the event was held at the company’s new state-of-the-art assembly plant located at karameh city, along Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Addressing newsmen at the event, Mikano Motors’ Sales Manager, Everistus Eze described local assembly of Geely automobile brand as part of his company’s efforts towards boosting the nation’s economy via job creation. He said: “Although Mikano has always been known as service provider in many aspects, including Power, Steel and Medical, our decision to invest in the automotive sector was motivated by our belief that Nigeria deserves a better transportation experience, rather than being a dumping area for second hand cars with no history, no warranty and no spare parts. “Therefore, we chose to assemble and ultimately manufacture a top quality automotive brand to create jobs for the youths, help stimulate the nation’s economy and further support Nigerian families with most comfortable and affordable means of transportation.” Aside being a Chinese automotive brand that recorded top scores in European Car Assessment Programme (EuroNcap), Geely vehicles, via its acquisition of top European brands, including Volvo and Lotus , are produced in line with European standard. According to him, the current Geely auto brand is entirely different from the former Geely Cars Nigerians used to know. “This current Geely auto brand,” he pointed out, “is a meeting point for the latest automobile technology and modern science. “ Mikano’s plan for locally assembled Geely automobiles started over two years ago. To ensure that its auto buying customers run their cars with peace of mind, the company has covered the entire landscape of Nigeria with various after sales service centres. “Already,” he explained, “we have 3s (Showroom, service centre and Spare parts) and 2s(Showroom and service Centre) locations all over Nigeria. The centres are equipped with modern tools to ensure effective after-sales services to our customers. “Through our appointed dealership across the country, Geely automobile brand’s spare parts are now available nationwide. While we are still appointing more dealers to ensure that our parts are available to every location in Nigeria, we are making servicing parts available via various accredited channels to avoid the incident of fake parts.” Locally Assembled EC7 Sedan Powered by 1.5-litre engine, the locally assembled Geely EC7 Sedan, comes with a load of safety features, some of which are Seatbelt reminder, Overspeeding alarm device, anti-theft alarm device, hand brake unreleased reminder, (Anti-lock Brake System + Electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) ,Reversing visual system, Door child safety lock, Collision safety fuel cut system, Speed-sensitive automatic door locking system, Explosion-proof leakproof plastic fuel tank, etc More than that, the car is equipped with Cruise control, Remote central locking, Keyless entry-driver side, Head restraints, Air conditioning system and infotainment.

Taking cognizance of affordability problem, which has trailed made-in-Nigeria vehicles over the years, Mikano, a company which employs over 2000 Nigerians, is already working out a friendly auto finance to take care of this challenge.
