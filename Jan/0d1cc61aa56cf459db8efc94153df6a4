Funmi Ogundare The Lagos State Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM), has commenced the year 2020 online teachers’ pensioners verification exercise, aimed at giving those who were deleted from the payroll for non-appearance during the last verification exercise an opportunity to be re-enlisted. With the exercise, their arrears would be paid and the names of pensioners who may have passed on during the course of the previous year deleted. Speaking on the mode of verification, the Chairman, TESCOM, Mrs. Elizabeth Ariyo affirmed that the verification exercise is in line with the state’s pensions policy which provided for annual auditing of the pensioners’ list for the purpose of updating the payroll in the old scheme. She explained that the verification is being done virtually in line with the COVID-19 protocol of physical distancing to prevent the spread of the virus and through designated WhatsApp lines. “I am very optimistic that the virtual verification will be more convenient for pensioners, both at home and in diaspora, as they will be verified in the comfort of their homes.” Ariyo added that the online verification serves as an avenue for the sick or bed ridden to participate in the exercise without stress of coming physically to the venue. “The exersice is expected to close on February 26, 2021. Pensioners are to make video calls only for verification via the following lines: 08096742362 and 09136559047.”
