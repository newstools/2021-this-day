By Segun James Following recent fire incident involving fuel tanker, the Lagos State Government has shut down Airport Bridge at Toyota on the Oshodi-Isolo Expressway. The state Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, in a statement issued yesterday, said the closure of the bridge to vehicular movement was to enable the government to conduct structural tests on the bridge. According to him, the state road management authorities have therefore created alternative routes for motorists pending the outcome of the tests. Oladeinde stated that motorists are therefore advised to make use of the alternative routes. The commissioner disclosed that motorists going from Mile 2 to Cele on Apapa-Oshodi Expressway will make use of Aiye and Osolo Way to Asa Afariogun through 7&8 to access International Airport Road. The commissioner explained that motorists from Toyota would use the service lanes by Armed Forces Resettlement Centre to BOC Gases on old NAFDAC Headquarters. “In the light of this development, the state traffic management officials shall be deployed to the aforementioned corridors to control and manage traffic flow along the axis during the course of the diversions. “The Lagos State Government is assuring the motoring public that the Airport Bridge shall be opened for use as soon as the tests or requisite intervention makes it safe and secure to do so,” he added.
