By Laleye Dipo The Niger State Pilgrims Welfare Board has said that the over 1,650 intending pilgrims that could not perform the pilgrimage to Mecca in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, will be given the opportunity to perform it in 2021. The Executive Secretary of the Board, Alhaji Umar Makun Lapai, who disclosed this in Minna on Thursday, however said those no longer interested in the pilgrimage can apply for the refund of the fares they have paid. Speaking at a capacity building workshop for the staff of the Board, Makun also disclosed that a Hajj saving scheme has been introduced to pave the way for intending pilgrims who cannot pay the Hajj fares in bulk to do so in instalment. “The Hajj saving scheme has come to stay in the state. It will soon be launched officially,” Makun said. He said the state government has also agreed to sponsor one trainer from each of the 25 local government areas as a guide to the pilgrims onshore and offshore programmes, adding that there are other welfare packages that the state pilgrims will enjoy from the state government during the 2021 Hajj operation.
He however did not give details Makun solicited for the support of the public for the Board to achieve its objective. He urged the staff to be dedicated to their duties and avoid any act that could tarnish their image or that of the Board, warning that those found violating the code of ethics of the Board will be penalized.
