Fine first-time finishes from James Maddison and Youri Tielemans helped Leicester beat Newcastle 2-1 and move to within a point of the top of the Premier League. Maddison fired in Jamie Vardy’s pull-back from just inside the penalty area to break Newcastle’s resistance before Tielemans curled home from 20 yards after Marc Albrighton’s pass. Andy Carroll’s equally impressive volley reduced the deficit, his first goal since rejoining Newcastle in August 2019. Leicester moved back above Tottenham into third, although they have played a game more than Spurs, leaders Liverpool and second-placed Manchester United. Having drawn their past two games, Leicester were in danger of dropping off the pace in the title race, but they showed their class in patches at St James’ Park and deserved three points. Apart from a tidy Vardy finish that was disallowed for offside, they were restricted to very little in the first half, although returning pair Maddison and Tielemans unlocked Newcastle after the break. Carroll stroked home to put some gloss on the scoreline for Newcastle – his first goal for the club since 2010 – but the hosts saw their winless league run extended to five games.
