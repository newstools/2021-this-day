Nigerian-born winger Bright Osayi-Samuel is reportedly drawing interest from Premier League and Championship clubs. Teamtalk says Crystal Palace and West Ham are looking at signing the versatile attacker in the January transfer window but face competition. Aside from the Eagles and Hammers, Osayi-Samuel is also interesting Championship promotion hopefuls Swansea City and Stoke City. The 23-year-old has not hidden his desire to play for a club higher up the football pyramid, having spent three years in the Championship with Queens Park Rangers. He has entered the final six months of his contract and the Hoops are prepared to sell him this month or risk losing him for little compensation in July. Since joining Queens Park Rangers from Blackpool, Osayi-Samuel has had thirteen goals and thirteen assists in 113 matches. Last season, Osayi-Samuel won QPR’s Goal of the Season for his brilliant strike against Birmingham City and Daphne Biggs Supporters’ Young Player of the Year award.
