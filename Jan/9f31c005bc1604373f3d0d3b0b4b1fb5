If you ask the average Nigerian businessman to share his or her experience in 2020, he or she will like to inundate you with some bitter-sweet tales. Indeed, you may not doubt him or her considering the inclement business climate under which many entrepreneurs around the world operated in 2020 owing largely to the outbreak of COVID-19. In spite of this doleful experience forced on many as a result of the pandemic, 2020 ended on a happy note for Jubril Adewale Tinubu, Group Chief Executive, Oando Plc. This should not come as a surprise to anyone who has been following his inspiring story with abiding interest. Over the years, he has sailed untroubled in the entrepreneurial ocean, navigating numerous business boats with the grace and nous of a veteran captain. Those that say money making is an art and that the trained lawyer is a maestro in the field, appear to be right. He has also succeeded in engraving his name in the hearts of the company’s shareholders with his business wizardry. While many who have worked with him in the past confirmed that he is a go-getter, it is also a fact that his clear vision has given Oando an edge over its competitors, thereby making it one of the leading oil firms not only in Nigeria but also in Africa. Think of one man who was born under the proverbial lucky star, his name will crop up. Popularly known as ‘King of African Oil,’ he is constantly in the limelight. Over the years, his success stories in the oil and gas industry have earned him a pride of place not only in Nigeria but beyond. One of the often-repeated jokes whenever his name comes up in any discussion among his business associates is that Tinubu talks business with ease.
