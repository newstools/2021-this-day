The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) yesterday said it received over 580,000 phone calls on COVID-19 between March and December 2020. The centre, whose mandate includes “leading the preparedness, detection, and response to infectious disease outbreaks and public health emergencies”, disclosed this in a statement, titled: ‘NCDC Announces 6232 as Short Code for Public Enquiries.’ The health agency described the quick code as a strategic tool for its surveillance and risk communications activities. Unveiled in partnership with the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the shortcode requires no charges, and it enables Nigerians to have access verified information on COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. NCDC’s Director-General, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, was quoted as saying, “Between March and December 2020, the NCDC Connect Centre received over 580,000 COVID-19 related phone calls. “The shortcode number ‘6232’ will be used alongside the existing toll-free number – ‘0800 9700 0010’, with a gradual phase-out of the existing toll-free number. “The NCDC remains strongly committed to working with relevant government institutions and partners to protect the health of Nigerians.” According to the statement, the shortcode can also be used to obtain verified information on other infectious diseases. “We urge the public to use the shortcode responsibly, in accessing verified information on COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.”
