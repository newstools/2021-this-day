The President of the Nigeria Golf Federation (NGF), Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, who will be 70 years old on February 3, is to be honoured with golf tournaments across the country. Already, two events have been slated to hold at the Miccom Golf Club in Ada, Osun State and another at the Ibadan Golf Club in the Oyo State capital to mark the birthday of the former Governor of Lagos and Osun states. The tournament at Ada is scheduled to hold on Sunday, February 6while the Ibadan event is billed for Saturday, February 13. However, words from the celebrant indicates that another event could hold at the IBB Golf Club in Abuja right after the Ibadan show. Expectedly, both the Ibadan and Ada games are fully booked with over 350 golfers from across the country expected to be in attendance in each of the events. It was also gathered that invited professionals could feature in both Ada and Ibadan games. Prince Oyinlola has since expressed gratitude over intentions of club captains to honour him with birthday tournaments. He reasoned that the Captains did not show such interest just because he is the President of the Golf Federation but they are doing so because they cherished absolute friendship he had shared with golfers across the country over the years. Hear Oyinlola: “I keep saying it that we don’t play golf just because we want to play. But we play because the game affords us room to share absolute friendship and camaraderie. This is evident in the manner several tournaments that are coming up to honour my day. I indeed thank ‘Golfers All’.
