The Bank of Industry (BoI) said its attention has been drawn to advertisements and letters on a purported recruitment exercise by the bank. Owing to this, it warned members of the public not to fall for fraudsters, saying it is not recruiting. The BoI gave the warning in a statement yesterday. It stated: “In one of the letters sighted, an applicant is asked to submit a copy of his national identity card, copies of academic and professional certificates, among others. “The Bank wishes to inform the general public that it is not undertaking recruitment in any form and in any part of the country or overseas. “Members of the public should be wary of fraudulent advertisements by recruitment agencies. For the avoidance of doubt, we wish to state that BoI is not recruiting now and it has not asked any agency or organisation to recruit on its behalf. It also does not demand payment in any form for job placement. “Anyone who entertains such invitations or deals with the fraudsters does so at his or her own risk. “The Bank of Industry continues to prioritise its support for MSMEs to stimulate national economic recovery and growth. “Once again, we wish to advise members of the public to be careful of fraudulent recruitment agencies.”
