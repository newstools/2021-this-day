Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said he is not like Sir Alex Ferguson and has “no skills for mind games” as he faced questions about Sunday’s match against league leaders Manchester United. The bitter rivals find themselves first and second in the table, with United leading the champions by three points. Klopp queried United’s penalty count recently, which was met by criticism from ex-referee Mark Clattenburg. “Am I surprised someone’s talking about what I have said? No,” said Klopp. “Am I surprised that Mark Clattenburg speaks about it? No. But it’s nice for him we can talk about him as well. “But I am not Sir Alex for different reasons. When people like Mark Clattenburg speak now it always says much more about them than it could ever about me.
“I have no skills for playing mind games, that is my problem.” Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side have been awarded 20 spot-kicks since the start of last season – twice as many as Liverpool, and since Klopp took over in October 2015 the tally is 67-46 in United’s favour.
