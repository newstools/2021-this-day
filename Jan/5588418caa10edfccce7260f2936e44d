Those who know Abiola Lukman Lawal, CEO/Managing Director of Quorum Energy Logistics, will attest to the fact that he is a stickler for excellence. So, to his far-flung fans, it didn’t come as a surprise that his chain of businesses, particularly the aviation and logistics business, has taken the industry by storm shortly after its launch. Any time he has the opportunity to talk about his humble beginning, he is always quick to say that he learnt the ABC of doing business, which includes foresightedness, steadfastness, courage, and adaptability to changes, from other magnates. Perhaps, the above are all that steadied his feet, following the crash of one of the helicopters in the fleet of Quorum Aviation, Bell 206BIII in Ikeja, Lagos in August 2020. At that time, many naysayers, especially those with a sense of schadenfreude, had gone to town thinking Lawal had hit rock bottom. But he was able to triumph over his adversity. It will be recalled that his aviation firm secured its Air Operators’ Certificate, OAC, in 2018, after scaling through five rigorous stages with the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, NCAA. Before founding his own company, the shrewd businessman had held management positions in firms such as Oando PLC, where he was an executive director, Gas & Power Division; chief strategy officer & executive vice president, CAMAC Energy Inc, a U.S.-based energy company engaged in the exploration, development, production, and distribution of oil and gas.
