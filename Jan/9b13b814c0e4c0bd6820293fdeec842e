This my brother was recently named Banker of the Decade by one major media house. The title didnâ€™t sit well with me for reasons I will not talk here. So, I sent a very strong message on my whats app and you know say na 10,000 people be that. Kind and legendary Richard Ikiebe, one big oga for the media firm reach out with some constructive arguments. We went back and forth and agreed to a middle ground. Well, this is not to remove from the obviously immense contributions of Mr. Okonkwo to the industry in a long and distinguished career. I say well-done bro and no matter my misgivings about the award, I still feel that you arrow-headed some level of revolution in the bank, leaving it in a far better place than you met it. Saw you the other day at the Southern Sun with my brother the hard-working Charles Aigbe, would have loved to shake your hands and say well done, but you were obviously in a hurry for a meeting. I chased you, followed you into the hall, and saw that you were addressing a world press briefing so I respect myself. Anyways, this is wishing you well in future endeavours. Well done and God bless.
