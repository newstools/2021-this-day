MTN Nigeria has selected 200 Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) across Nigeria to benefit from an accelerator programme, Y’ello 200, in continuation of The Revv Programme. The initiative was launched to address the critical needs of MSMEs as well as to mitigate against the effects of COVID-19 on their businesses. Adopting a four-pronged approach that includes masterclasses, access to market, productivity tools support and advisory initiatives, the programme also seeks to address issues in the areas of re-igniting the economy by driving digital inclusion for SMEs. To further this cause, 200 top-performing MSMEs have been selected from participants in The Revv Masterclasses to undergo further upskilling. The Y’ello 200 was unveiled at the closing ceremony of The Revv Programme which held virtually recently.
Speaking at the closing ceremony, the Chief Enterprise Business Officer, MTN Nigeria, Lynda Saint-Nwafor, congratulated the selected MSMEs. She said, “These 200 MSMEs were selected based on their performance and polls during the masterclasses. With MSMEs accounting for 94 per cent of all businesses in Nigeria and 84 per cent of employment, it is a known fact that when MSMEs thrive, the economy thrives. “Our goal is to empower MSMEs with the tools to make them thrive in today’s digital economy. The Revv Programme has not ended but enters into its next phase.”
