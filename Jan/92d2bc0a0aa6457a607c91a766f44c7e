Amazon.com Inc. has filed a motion asking the US National Labor Relations Board to halt the union election at its Bessemer, Alabama warehouse, scheduled to start February 8. The company also requested a review of an earlier labor board decision to hold the election by mail due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a filing dated January 21. Amazonâ€™s first US union election since 2014 was scheduled to begin with the mailing of ballots in early February and a vote count starting March 30. The online retail giant, which is the second-largest private employer in the United States after Walmart Inc, has long avoided unionization and has trained managers to spot organising activity. According to Reuters, the company alleged multiple gaps in labor board precedent, errors made by the acting regional director, and missed opportunities for mail-ballot improvements to back its motion.
