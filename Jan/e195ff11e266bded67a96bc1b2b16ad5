By David-Chyddy Eleke Two unidentified men, travelling in a white Toyota Hilux vehicle with registration number Kogi BJK 527 AA, have been shot dead in Imo State. The men were reportedly attacked by unknown gunmen, who pumped bullets into their car, through the windscreen, killing them, when they were on a journey. A video of the corpses of the men, which is currently trending on the internet, showed a body on the back seat of the car, while voices at the background showed that the driver of the vehicle was still alive when villagers got to the scene of the tragic incident, but later died. Though the video stated that the incident happened in Ihiala, Anambra State, it was however gathered that the attack took place in Awo Idemili community in Orsu Local Government Area of Imo state, which is a border town, while the victims were rushed to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Ihiala for treatment. Villagers called for identification of the victims by their relatives, to enable them take their corpses home for burial. Meanwhile, the Anambra State Police Command has stated that no such incident happened in the state, insisting that the trending video, which purports the attack to have taken place in Ihiala, Anambra State was misleading. Spokesperson of the command, CSP Haruna Mohammed, in a press release said, “The report which neither states the date nor time of the incident is absolutely misleading with the tendency of creating tension and panic in the State. “Preliminary inquiry conducted by the Command revealed that the alleged incident took place at Awoidemili community in Orsu Local Government Area of Imo state. Victims were only rushed to Our Lady of Lourdes hospital, Ihiala where they were confirmed dead by the medical doctor.” He added that the Divisional Police headquarters where the incident took place in Imo State had since commenced investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident.
