So, Joe Biden wears a Rolex watch. If thatâ€™s the only thing that people are attacking him on, and it does seem to be, then the Presidency is in much better shape. Of course, there is no way it could ever have been worse. It appears that Trump also wore a Rolex, although mostly on the golf course but that again was because he spent so much time there. How about we all look for the good in the person now. Dennis Fitzgerald,
