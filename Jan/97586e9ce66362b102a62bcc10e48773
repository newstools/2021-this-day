Any serious investment into any of these three basic needs is always viable and profitable. The proposed project is grouped into shelter, which is a very profitable investment. PVC or Vinyl as it is commonly called is used in variety of commonly consumer products. Vinyl is used in building products such as vinyl ceiling, PVC pipes, windows and doors, roofs etc. It is established amongst scientist that there is no other plastic that possesses such direct environmental and human friendly as PVC throughout its entire product lifecycle. The world all over has moved towards PVC products such as PVC pipes, PVC windows and doors and ceilings because it is rated as the most environmental friendly. It requires no painting, it is also termite proof, fire proof, and typhoon rated, excellent security and above all excellent value for money. Apart from PVC pipes and fittings, an investor can diversify into PVC windows, doors and ceiling production.
PVC windows, doors and ceiling have been proved to give house its distinctive look. From outside, they give the house its personal characteristics and inside they give the house the right it needs and the aesthetic appearance.
It has been established facts that PVC products are easy to maintain, anti-fungi, economical, easy to install, excellent endurance to varying weather conditions and also 100% mechanically recyclable. Due to all these advantages, PVC products are used widely by different industries ranging from construction industry, automobile industry, electrical industry, advertising industry, civil industry, woollen industry, air-conditioning and refrigeration to mention but few. From research conducted, Nigerians have fallen in love with PVC products and the demand has gone up tremendously. As a result, many of these products are imported from oversea producers, since very few Nigerian producers cannot meet up with the rising demand for the products.
Many more investors are required in the country to boost supply and cushion the effect of huge, expanding local demand. According to international plastic pipe and fittings Association (PPFA), the international acceptable standard must be applied in any part of the world. Based on their recommendation, the proposed project must maintain the internationally acceptable standard. This recognition is vital to manufacturers because it provides some assurance of consistency amongst regulatory authorities referencing these standards for compliance purposes. There are various stipulated standard for production of water pipes, drain, waste & vent pipes, process pipe, sewer pipe, folded PVC pipes etc. The colors are usually used for PVC pipes and there are recommended colour codes. The implication of these standard requirements is that any prospective investor in Nigeria needs professional advice of consultants. To invest in this project prospective investors needed to have at least 2 plots of land for take-off.
The machines required for the setting up of this project include- Hot/Cooling mixer, automatic loader, twin screw extruder and calibrating system, vacuum & calibrating tank, water cooling tank printer, Haul off, cutter and stacker. Details of the machines, sources and prices will be given to prospective investors.
There are various sizes of the pipes in the market. However, based on our market research, not all of them are marketable. Some are more in demand than others.

For the required manpower, the number depend on the following departments-research & product development, design & manufacturing department, testing/inspection & quality control department, marketing, accounts & administration and production delivering & installations. There should be other supporting staff. Details will also be given to prospective investors.
