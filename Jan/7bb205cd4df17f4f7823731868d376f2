As preparation for Ehingbeti, the Lagos Economic Summit holding on February 16 -18, 2021 intensifies, members of the organised private sector (OPS) has their re-affirmed commitment to continued deployment of the platform as a channel for setting developmental agenda for Lagos State. At a recent stakeholders’ conference, where key private sector operators in Nigeria gathered for the upcoming Lagos Economic Summit, the OPS stressed the need for government to focus on infrastructural development, job creation, waste management and social issues. Other areas listed for government’s consideration by the group are investment in technology and innovation, security, while government was also advised to enable the large population of entrepreneurial youth domiciled in the state to take advantage of their skills and talents. “The government should match manpower development with available needs to create room for employment,” a statement quoted the Chairman, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Ikeja branch, Francis Meshioye, to have said. He added, “there are many companies domiciled in Lagos, adding that if the growth of industrialists is eroded, it will affect the economy and gross domestic product of the country at large”. “Lagos needs more industrial clusters to become the desired economic hub, adding that government should create viable links to channel goods from one cluster to another” concluded Meshioye. Earlier, the Director-General, Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), Ambassador Ayoola Olukanni, said attention needs to be focused on municipal solid waste. Olukanni, who expressed support for the summit, said Lagos State was still struggling with issues of waste management, which if not tackled could become a disaster. According to him, there is a national policy on waste management, waste to energy, and wealth, which should be one of the studies at the summit.
