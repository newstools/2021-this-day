By David-Chyddy Eleke Operatives of the Anambra State Police Command have confirmed the arrest of the Founder of Children of Light Anointing Ministries in Nkpor, Idemili North Local Government Area of the state, Mr. Onyebuchi Okocha, popularly known as ‘Onyeze Jesus’. The prophet was rumoured to have been arrested in his house in Nkpor, near Onitsha, last Wednesday night, which was confirmed by the state Police Public Relations Officer, CSP Haruna Mohammed, saying: “Yes, we arrested Onyeze Jesus yesterday (Wednesday).” The arrest of the cleric came less than a week after the state government issued a statement condemning his activities and warning citizens to be wary of him. Before his arrest, Okocha had promised to raise seven corpses from the mortuary of a government approved hospital in Nkpor. He became popular for sending out viral videos on the internet of him taking adults to the river and making them bathe naked, with the claim he was cleansing them of bad luck to prepare them for wealth. The prophet, who many alleged to be fake, had boasted that on Thursday (yesterday), he was going to resurrect seven dead people from a mortuary in a hospital in the state, forcing the state ministry of health to warn that no hospital must open its morgue for him. Though details of the reason for the arrest of the prophet has not been made known, Anambra State Government had earlier threatened to arrest him for indecent exposure of people’s nude, and for also disrespecting Nigerian currency. Okocha, while preparing money rituals for his followers, usually make them bathe naked in a river, while he sprayed them money in their state. The state government in a statement condemning his act had stated that his conduct was not in sync with what Anambra people are known for, and that such conduct was capable of giving the state a bad name.
