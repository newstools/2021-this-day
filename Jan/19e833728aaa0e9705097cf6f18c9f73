The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has opened its case against a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Babachir Lawal, accused of N544 million fraud. Lawal is facing criminal prosecution alongside his younger brother, Hamidu David Lawal, as well as Sulaiman Abubakar; Apeh John Monday; Rholavision Engineering Ltd, and Josmon Technologies Ltd. They were re-arraigned on a 10-count charge bordering on diversion of funds, criminal conspiracy and official corruption before Charles Agbaza, a federal capital territory (FCT) high court judge, on November 30, 2020, following the demise of Jude Okeke, the previous trial judge. The Cable reported that at the resumed trial yesterday, Mohammed Babansule, a relationship manager with the First City Monument Bank (FCMB), was called as the first prosecution witness. In his examination-in-chief, the witness, who is the account manager of the sixth defendant (Josmon Technologies Ltd), told the court that the account opening form and other documents submitted to the bank showed that Apeh, the fourth defendant, is the signatory to the account. Babansule said although the company account was opened in 2015, he became the relationship manager in June 2018. The witness presented copies of the account opening package, registration forms of the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), as well as copies of the directorâ€™s international passport and utility bill. Prosecution Counsel, OI Uket, urged the court to admit the documents in evidence. With no objection from the defence counsel, the judge admitted the documents as exhibits 1 to 33. The matter has been adjourned till January 21, 2021, for continuation.
