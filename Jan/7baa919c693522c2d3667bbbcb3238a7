The governor, while signing the budget yesterday at the council chamber of the Government House in Maiduguri, the state capital, charged all ministries, agencies and departments (MDAs) of the government to comply strictly with the provisions of the 2021 budget. He also directed his cabinet members to accelerate activities in their ministries for the people of the state to derive maximum benefit. Zulum expressed appreciation to the leadership and members of the state House of Assembly for their cooperation with the executive arm of the government. The governor explained that in 2021, his administration would sustain its priority on security, education, healthcare, agriculture, provision of portable water as well as reconstruction, rehabilitation and resettlement of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees. The Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Hon.
