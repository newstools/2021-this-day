Wema Bank Plc said it was ranked top in two recent independent surveys on the banking industry. The bank revealed that in its 2020 Digital Channel scorecard, KPMG Nigeria named it as a leader in Payments and Transactions for digital banking. Also, in its recently released Banking Industry Customer Experience Survey, the consulting firm confirmed that Wema Bank climbed 10 places to second position in the retail category. Following a qualitative study of 17 Nigerian commercial banks focusing strongly on retail banking operations, KPMG Nigeria’s Digital scorecard tested customer experience across five areas – Digital Onboarding, Digital Payments & Transfers, Digital Lending, Self Service and Customer Care. It categorised banks into four distinct categories – Leaders, Challengers, Followers and Late Starters. “Wema Bank emerged a leader in the Mobile and Internet banking (payments/transfers) and the Self-Service categories,” the statement added. The assessment also revealed ALAT By Wema, the bank’s digital banking platform, as the best digital banking channel in Nigeria. According to the report, ALAT By Wema stands out because, “the user interface is simple, and only relevant information is visible on the screen, thus keeping design minimal, user friendly, and removing the possibilities for user errors or confusion”. The digital banking platform has not only provided the latest banking technology, it fits perfectly into the lifestyle of Nigerians; making life easier for everyone.
