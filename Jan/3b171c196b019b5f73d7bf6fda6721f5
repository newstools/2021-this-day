Following Akwa United’s 2-1 victory over Abia Warriors at the weekend, Head Coach, Kennedy Boboye, has hinted that his boys are charged up to record their second win of the season when they engage Kwara United in a midweek NPFL clash this afternoon in Ilorin. Coach Boboye who heaped praises on his players after their first win of the season explained that the victory over his former team was a divine turnaround that his team needed to kick start their campaign. Boboye told the club’s website www.akwaunitedfc.comyesterday that his team is on course for more victories. “Our victory over Abia Warriors is a big motivation for us and it’s coming at the right time. We are determined to build on that win as we continue to push for more victories. “The celebration of that victory ended after the match and our concentration and focus is now on Wednesday’s match against Kwara United. “Last season, Kwara United came to Uyo and picked all three points. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic we didn’t have the opportunity of playing the return fixture, that is why this game is very important and trust me, we are on a special mission to Ilorin. The Promise Keepers are 11th on the NPFL table with four points. In the last eight meetings between the two sides, Akwa United and Kwara United have recorded three wins apiece while two of those encounters ended in stalemate. Elsewhere, Stanley Eguma’s Rivers United arrived Bauchi yesterday afternoon ahead of their midweek fixture with Wikki Tourists. The “Pride of Rivers” will battle the Giant Elephant at the Abubarkar Tafawa Balewa Stadium and will aim to reproduce the kind of performance that earned them a 1-0 win in their last away tie against Abia Warriors in Aba.
