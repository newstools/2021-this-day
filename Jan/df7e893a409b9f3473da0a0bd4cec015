The Lagos State Police Command has said it arrested 43 clubbers including strippers for violating the COVID-19 protocol in the state. The state police command made the arrests when operatives on a COVID-19 protocol enforcement exercise paid a visit to Eclipse Night Club, Ligali Ayorinde Street, Victoria Island on Sunday, January 10, 2021. This was disclosed in a statement signed by the Police Public Relations Officer, Lagos State Command, Olumuyiwa Adejobi. The statement said the Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, who had already ordered the Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers and Heads of Department in the command to be on the prowl of violators of the preventive protocols, reiterated his zero tolerance for violation of the protocols. “The Police operatives attached to Maroko Division of the state, on the order of the Commissioner of Police, CP Hakeem Odumosu, went after the deviant clubbers and got them arrested in the club clustering and clubbing without any regard for the COVID-19 protocols,” the statement said. It added, saying, Odumosu “has ordered that the suspects be moved to Taskforce office Oshodi for prosecution. The police boss has also ordered that club owners should no longer be spared as they encourage total disregard for the protocols in the state.” Odumosu, however, admonished the residents of the state to be law-abiding and value their lives as the pandemic is a global reality.
