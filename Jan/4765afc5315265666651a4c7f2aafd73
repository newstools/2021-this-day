WAFU B U-17 Tournament Five-time world champions, Golden Eaglets of Nigeria yesterday booked their place in the final of the 2021 U17 Africa Cup of Nations holding in Morocco courtesy of their hard-fought 1-0 win against Burkina Faso in the zonal qualifiers.
FataiAmoo’s wards started the competition on a shaky note losing by the odd goal to Cote d’Ivoire, but then were held to a 1-1 draw by Ghana in their second game in the three-team Group B. They looked to be on their way home until Cote d’Ivoire trashed Ghana 3-1 to allow the Eaglets slip into the last four.
The defending champions of WAFU-UFOA B struggled to create clear cut chances in the first half as both teams went into the break level.
Thirteen minutes from time, Michael Emmanuel Papo scored the only goal of the game as he managed to slot the ball home despite the futile attempts of the Burkina Faso goalkeeper to stop him from shooting.
There were five passes in the build up to the brilliant team goal finished by the Golden Eaglets number 8.
Victory means the Golden Eaglets are now not only eligible to battle for the tournament’s diadem, but have also joined the teams that have qualified for the 2021 U17 Africa Cup of Nations holding in Morocco March 13 – 31.
Nigeria will meet either Ivory Coast or Republic of Niger in the final of the WAFU B U17 Tournament at the Stade de Kégué, Lomé on Monday.
Eaglets are the most successful team in the world at this level of competition having won the U17 World Cup for a record five times.
Their last triumph was achieved at the 2015 edition when they silenced Mali 2-0 in the final thanks to second-half strikes from Victor Osimhen and FunshoBamgboye.
