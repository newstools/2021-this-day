The African Union, European Union, United States, United Kingdom and all people of conscience have been urged to condemn in the strongest possible terms the ongoing assault on Uganda’s opposition by President Yoweri Museveni. The call was made by a group of human rights activists, lawyers, journalists, academics, musicians, filmmakers and writers in Europe, North America and Africa in a statement released on Thursday. Presidential and parliamentary elections were held in Uganda on January 14. 76-year-old Museveni, who had been in power since 1986, is seeking reelection in a poll characterized by arrest and intimidation of his opponents. There are fears that the elections will not be free or fair as Museveni is determined to secure a sixth term in office. A statement Thursday called on the international community to play an active role calling on the Uganda government to hold free and fair elections without intimidation and violence. The statement read: “President Museveni, who has enjoyed strong Western backing for 35 years-and tens of billions of dollars in military and financial assistance– will contest his 6th term in office. His main presidential challenger, musician/legislator, Hon Robert Kyagulanyi MP, better known to us as Bobi Wine, as well as another opposition candidate Patrick Amuriat, have both been repeatedly arrested by security forces, and scores, perhaps hundreds of their supporters have been tortured and killed. “Thousands of other opposition supporters are detained, many without access to lawyers, doctors or their families. On December 30, Wine’s entire entourage-security detail, media team and medical team was arrested. Some of them, all previously in good health, appeared in court on Monday, limping from injuries sustained while in police custody. They were given bail but have not been released. Since then, with a fresh team, Bobi continued his campaign. That team, as well, have all been arrested.” The statement said that Wine’s campaign in particular had reached nearly every corner of the country, where massive crowds had braved teargas and bullets to cheer on his candidacy. It however added that every mile of that journey had been fraught with danger. “In November, demonstrations broke out across Uganda when Wine was detained for two days incommunicado, supposedly for violating COVID 19 regulations. The last time he’d been so detained, in 2018, he’d emerged on crutches. In response to the public outcry, Museveni deployed his private army, known as the Special Forces Command to “restore order”. At least 54 demonstrators and bystanders, including children, were gunned down and killed, and scores of others were severely injured. “This is Museveni’s “democracy” that carried him victoriously through multiple elections over 35 years. Bobi still ventures forth to meet his constituents, following the itinerary provided by the Electoral Commission. But with his entire security team in detention, his only security is international media coverage, shining a harsh light on the regime’s excessive use of brutal force. Museveni claims Bobi’s support comes only from “foreign homosexuals.” The world is watching,” the statement added. The statement said: “We the undersigned call upon the African Union, US, UK, EU and all people of conscience to condemn in the strongest possible terms the ongoing assault on Uganda’s opposition and commit to support a safe free and fair election for all Ugandan citizens.” Below is the list of those that signed the statement: ADAM CLAYTON – Musician U2 Ireland ADAM SHATZ – Writer London Review of Books UK ALAN KEMP – Marketing Executive UK ALEXANDER STILLE – Professor at Columbia University USA ALFIE BENGE – Artist UK ALFONSO CUARON – Filmmaker Mexico AMANDA DE CADENET – Filmmaker and Photographer USA AMIR AMIRANI – Filmmaker UK ANISH KAPOOR – Artist UK ARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU – South Africa BARONESS ROSIE BOYCOTT – Journalist UK BELINDA ATIM – Uganda Sustainable Development Initiative UK BETTE ADRIAANSE – Artist The Netherlands BIYI BANDELE – Author, Film Director Nigeria BRENDA GILBERT – Film Producer USA BONO – Musician U2 Ireland BRIAN ENO – Artist, Musician, Producer UK BRONAGH GALLAGHER – Actress and Singer Northern Ireland CATIE GINSBURG – Partisan Records USA CHARLOTTE CHURCH – Singer Activist and Founder of the Awen Project UK CHRIS MARTIN – Musician Coldplay USA COSMUS ZAVUGA – University of Manitoba Canada CORNELIA PARKER OBE – Artist UK DANIEL KRAMER – Founder/Director The Visceral Glitch USA DANIEL LANOIS – Musician/Music Producer Canada DAVID MITCHELL – Novelist UK DAVID KAU – Comedian and Filmmaker South Africa DIANA NESLEN – Retired UK DR NISHANT JOSHI – Doctor and Activist UK DR MEENAL JOSHI – Doctor and Activist UK DR PAUL WILLIAMS – Doctor and former MP – UK EMILY YOUNG FRSS – Sculptor UK FEMI ANIKULAPO KUTI – Musician Nigeria FEMI FALANA – Human Rights Advocate Nigeria FOLARIN ‘FALZ’ FALANA – Entertainer Nigeria FRANK RYNNE – Senior Lecturer France GARETH DAVIES – Publicist (retired) UK GARY LUCAS – Musician USA GEETA DAYAL – Writer UK GEORGIA BYNG – Children’s Author UK GUY BERRYMAN – Musician Coldplay USA HARDI YAKUBU – Fighter-General The Economic Fighters League Ghana HELEN EPSTEIN – Author and Journalist USA HENRY LOUIS GATES – Harvard University USA HENRY PORTER – Writer UK HUGH CORNWELL – Songwriter USA IAIN NEWTON – Marketing Consultant USA IAIN OVERTON – Investigative Journalist, Author UK JAMES THORNTON – Lawyer Client Earth UK JEAN-MICHEL REUSSER – Music Producer France JEFF SMITH – CEO Vanguard Africa USA JESSE RIBOT – Professor at American University USA JIM MCCARTY – Musician UK JOE BOYD – Author and Record Producer UK JON MCCLURE – Musician Reverend and the Makers UK JONATHAN REEKIE – Arts Administrator Somerset House Trust UK JONATHAN ROSENHEAD – Emeritus Professor London School of Economics UK JOHN CARRUTHERS – Music Executive UK JOHN GONCALVES – Musician Portugal JOHN REYNOLDS – Music Producer UK JONNY BUCKLAND – Musician Coldplay USA JOSEPH NDAWULA – LAWYER UGANDA J.
