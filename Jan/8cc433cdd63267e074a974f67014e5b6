Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum; Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Garbai El-Kanemi; some traditional rulers and top government officials in the state yesterday held a funeral prayer for the late Shehu of Dikwa, Mohammed Ibn Masta II. The funeral prayer was led by the Imam Idaini of Borno State, Imam Shettima Mamman Saleh, at the Shehu of Borno’s palace in Maiduguri. Ibn Masta II died in Abuja last Saturday at the age of 75 after a protracted illness. The governor, while speaking to journalists during an interview after the funeral prayer, described the death of the late Shehu as shocking and a great loss. He said: “Indeed it is a very sad moment for the people of Borno State, and in particular, the people of Dikwa Emirate Council. The late Shehu was a legend; he was humble, and a generous person. We will miss him a lot. May Almighty Allah in his infinite mercy forgive and admit him into Jannatul Firdaus. “It was so shocking, because he was a unifying factor in Dikwa Emirate Council. His absence will seriously create a vacuum. There should be no way we will continue our scheduled activities in southern Borno when we lost a king. We came back home immediately in order to witness the funeral prayer.” On his part, the Shehu of Borno described the death of the late monarch as a great loss to the people of the state. He said: “It is very sad and a great pity actually. It is a great loss for us. In fact, he is one of the most respected rulers-number two in the ranking of the traditional institution in the state. After me, it was the Shehu of Dikwa. Indeed it is a great loss not only to his immediate family or the people of Dikwa, but the entire state. May Almighty Allah grant him into Jannatul Firdaus.”
