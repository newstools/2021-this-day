In commemoration of the 2021 International Day of Education, Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc has reaffirmed its commitment to providing support and ensuring accessible education to the Nigerian child. The United Nations (UN) had proclaimed 24 January as the International Day of Education, in recognition of the impact of education in bringing sustainable development across the world. The 2021 International Day of Education is themed: “Recover and Revitalise Education for the COVID-19 Generation.” Speaking on the relevance of the celebration to Stanbic IBTC, Chief Executive, Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc, Wole Adeniyi, was quoted in a statement to have said: “Our organisation is keen on positively impacting the education sector to drive national development.” Adeniyi noted that education serves as one of the core pillars of Stanbic IBTC’s CSI initiatives. He emphasised that the end-to-end financial institution would continue to show its unrelenting support towards growth in the Nigerian educational system. According to him, “we embark on several initiatives aimed at improving education for the Nigerian child, even in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic when many students struggled to keep up with learning during the nationwide lockdown.” Adeniyi highlighted that the company had been actively involved in empowering the younger generation with financial literacy knowledge through its “New School Money Initiative”. Wealth certified professionals in the organisation educated preteens and teenagers on how to develop a savings and investment culture through virtual sessions. They shed more light on subjects to distinguish between wants and needs, assets and liabilities, and the importance of making the right financial decisions. These were effectively communicated using simple, relatable videos and illustrations.
