Chuks Okocha in Abuja The founder of Omega Fire Ministry, Apostle Johnson Suleiman, has been advised to leave politics for politicians, and face his spiritual calling. The caution came against the backdrop of Suleiman’s latest prophesy that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo would emerged the president of the country. Warning the cleric to steer clear of politics, the pioneer Director-General of Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), Osaro Onaiwu, declared that President Muhammadu Buhari will complete his second term. Onaiwu added that some of the comments from some “Men of God” have a way of heighten tension in the country. He further stated that President Buhari would live to complete the constitutional mandate given to him by Nigerians. The former director-general of the NGF, therefore, urged the clergyman to face the work of God squarely, and strategise on how to win souls for God instead of dishing out prophesies capable of dislocating the fragile fabric that hold the country together. According to Onaiwu in a statement made available to journalists, “We should be wary of what we utter at a time like this in the country’s history. Nigeria is for all of us. President Buhari will complete his tenure, and nothing will change that. “I am calling on Apostle Suleiman to be wary of the kind of prophesy he dishes out at this time. He should understand the implication of his prophesy that Osinbanjo will emerged the president of the country when the elected president is still there. “What we need now is how Nigeria will move forward and not how things will be stagnated. We need the opinion and advice of men that will move the country forward.”
