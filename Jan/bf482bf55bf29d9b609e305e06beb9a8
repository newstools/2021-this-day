Bennett Oghifo The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye has said it would take the intervention of God to free the world of the Coronavirus and its variants. Pastor Adeboye, who stated this in his “Prophecies for 2021” released after the church’s virtual crossover service, said for every COVID-19 vaccine discovered, a new variant of the virus will emerge until the high and mighty admit that safety is of God. Scientists are presently contending with the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines on all the variants of the virus, and according to Adeboye, “This will continue until the high and mighty admit that safety is of the Lord.” He said, “Some of the things that happened in 2020 will spill over into 2021.
“The world as a whole can only come out of the wounds when they admit the following;
“That it is the Most High that rules in the affairs of men not science. Daniel 4:25.
“That it is God that gives wisdom to the wise. Daniel 2:20-21. That God can reduce the so called wisdom of man to foolishness. 1 Corinthians 1:19-20. 4). “That for every vaccine discovered, there is already a variant in the making. This will continue until the high and mighty admit that safety is of the Lord. Proverbs 21:31. “God says He will begin to deal with nations on individual basis so that in any nation, if God’s people will humble themselves and pray, He will heal their land. 2 Chronicles 7:14.”
He said, “God wants us in Nigeria to know that only God can lift a siege. 2 Kings 7:1-end. The humble who put their trust in God will see the end of the siege. James 4:6.”
