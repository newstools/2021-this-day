The Healthcare Federation of Nigeria (HFN) has appealed for government to consider harnessing the vast expertise and resources within the Nigerian private sector in order to ensure a successful roll-out of Covid19 vaccines. This appeal was made at the recently concluded Nigerian Governors Forum. The President of HFN, Dr. Pamela Ajayi, speaking on behalf of the Federation urged government to consider the enormous benefits of private sector participation in the task of getting Covid-19 vaccine to the millions of Nigerians that need it. Private sector involvement can help ensure smooth and effective procurement and roll out of the vaccines while reducing the cost to government. HFN was instrumental in providing critical support during the first phase of the pandemic by mobilising the private sector response which led to the setup of isolation centers, increasing access to PCR testing and supporting State responses. HFN is currently organising a private sector roundtable, bringing both the private healthcare and private sectors together and its members have pledged their commitment to supporting both the federal and state governments in fighting the pandemic. HFN members, which span all facets of healthcare, are keen to support at both the state and federal levels in all aspects from supply, to the provision of critical infrastructure and all other aspects of the vaccine distribution, training, information dissemination and provision of facilities to facilitate last mile administration. The private sector aims to absorb and cushion the complexities involved in such huge operations. In addition, she said the Private sector could provide innovative financing. She also stated that stakeholders, including individuals and corporate organizations are willing to pay for the vaccines, as the second wave of Covid19 continues to rise.
