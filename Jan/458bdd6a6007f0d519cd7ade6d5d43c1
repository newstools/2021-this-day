*Says plotters target South-east, Lagos, Sokoto, Kano, Plateau, Oyo By Kingsley Nwezeh The Department of State Security (DSS) Monday issued a security alert over plot by some elements to instigate religious violence in the country. It said the plotters in collaboration with foreign forces targeted South-east, Lagos, Sokoto, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau and Oyo States. The agency warned those behind the plot to desist from doing so in the interest of peace and security of the nation. A statement issued by Spokesman of DSS, Dr Peter Afunanya, said part of the plan was to cause inter-religious conflicts as well as use their foot soldiers to attack some worship centres, religious leaders, personalities, key and vulnerable points in the country. “Consequently, Nigerians are advised to be wary of these antics and shun all divisive tendencies aimed at inciting or setting them against one another. “While the service pledges to collaborate with sister agencies to ensure that public order is maintained, those hatching these plots are warned to desist from such in the interest of peace, security and development of the country”, it said. The agency urged law abiding citizens to report suspected breaches of peace around them to the nearest security agencies”, it said.
