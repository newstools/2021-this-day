The Ogun State Executive Council has approved for immediate reconstruction, the 2.35km Journalists Estate Road at Arepo in the Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of the state. According to the Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure in the State, Mr. Ade Akinsanya, “preliminary work had already commenced and the contractor was expected to mobilise to site this weekend. This is a high priority project and work at site will start soon.” “The contractor is in the process of establishing an office and construction yard around the area,” he added noting that “when work begin on Sunday, I (Akinsanya) will be visiting the project site in company with the contractor-in-charge.” Akinsanya said the project had a nine month construction period adding that the road “which is 13 metres wide, 1m by 1m covered reinforced drainage, and stone pavement when completed, would be fully illuminated with street light, lay byes, and other exotic road furniture.” The commissioner assured that Governor Abiodun prioritised the road at Arepo because when completed it would provide relief for road users along the Lagos-Ibadan express axis that had faced difficult times navigating their ways to their homes, especially during rainy season.
