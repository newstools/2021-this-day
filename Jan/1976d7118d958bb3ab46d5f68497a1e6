Tech4Dev, a non-profit social enterprise that creates access to entrepreneurship opportunities and platforms for Africans in partnership with Microsoft are joining forces to upscale the Nigerian Women Techsters Initiative. The programme has trained 2,400 women and girls across 12 communities in Nigeria. It aims to train five million girls and women across Africa over the next 10 years. This will be done by providing skills in coding and deep tech skills towards bridging the digital and technology divide between men and women as well as ensuring equal access to opportunities for all while helping women achieve economic empowerment across Africa. The initiative will be launched at a virtual conference, scheduled to hold today. “As 2021 continues to heed the call against the plight against the COVID-19 pandemic, economies and industries are forced to place acute awareness on issues of equality – particularly within science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields,” it said. It said that it will take 200 years before there is parity between men and women working in senior STEM roles.
