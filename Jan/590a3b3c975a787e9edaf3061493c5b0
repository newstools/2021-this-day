Wole Ayodele in Jalingo The Chairman of Ardo Kola Local Government Area of Taraba State, Mr. Salihu Dovo, was yesterday abducted from his home in Jalingo, Taraba State, and taken to the bush by gunmen where he was eventually killed. Also, his brother, identified as Timothy, who attempted to stop the assailants from taking Dovo away, was also killed by the gunmen. The gunmen, numbering 20, had stormed his residence at the Sabon Geri area of the town at about 1 a.m. from where he was abducted, and taken into the bush where his corpse was later recovered. Confirming the incident, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), David Misal, disclosed that hours after abducting the chairman, the gunmen placed a call to an official of the local government area that he has been killed and that his family should go and recover his body from the bush. Misal, who spoke to THISDAY on the phone, also revealed that three suspects have been arrested in connection with the incident just as he assured them that the police command would get to the root of the matter. According to him, “The armed men stormed the chairman’s house at Sabon Geri at about 1 a.m. on Sunday and took him away into the bush. The gunmen later called that he has been killed and his body dumped in the bush. “A search team was raised and dispatched to look for the body, which was eventually found in the bush from where it was deposited in the morgue.” The PPRO, however, stated that the suspects arrested are already providing useful information that would assist the police to unravel those behind the dastardly act. THISDAY, however, gathered that one of the suspects was beaten to coma by irate mob who meted jungle justice on him, but was later rushed to the hospital by security agents where he’s receiving treatment as at the time of filing the report.
