Deji Elumoye in Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with the family of former Head of State, late General Sani Abacha, over the death of Hajiya Fatima (Fanta) Garba Mohammed. Buhari in a release issued on Saturday by his Media Adviser, Femi Adesina, expressed condolences over the passage of Hajiya Fatima, the immediate younger sister of late General Abacha and mother of Senator Basheer Mohammed (Lado), Federal Commissioner, National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). The President while sympathising with the Abacha family, Senator Lado and his siblings as well as the people of Kano State, noted that Hajia Fatima, who lived to the age of 75, devoted her time on earth to caring for the less-privileged and godly upbringing of her children.
Buhari prayed that Allah will console all those who mourn and grant Hajiya Fanta Aljannatul Firdaus.
