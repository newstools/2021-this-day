By Onyebuchi Ezigbo The Rector of the Federal College of Dental Technology and Therapy, Enugu (FEDCODTTEN), Dr. John Emaimo, has said the hospital’s team has discovered that turbine gas-powered ventilators are more effective than those powered by electricity. According to a statement by the institution’s Head of Public Relations, Mr. Omololu Ogunmade, weekend, the institution said it has blazed the trail in the production of ventilators, sanitizers and masks as part of its contributions to efforts aimed at containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the country. The statement said the Rector stated that operations of electricity powered-ventilators will be disrupted whenever power supply fails, while gas powered-ventilators can function uninterrupted for days. He said that the unique invention had attracted the interest of the authorities of National Orthopaedic Hospital. Emaimo said that when the hospital’s team visited the college to examine the quality of the ventilators, they gave a thumbs up to the college for the laudable initiative. The rector added that the college was prepared to patent the products by selling the rights to produce the ventilators to a company that will in turn be paying it for its initiative. The statement said the college has also produced large quantities of masks, face shields and sanitizers and distributed them to the appropriate places for usage of citizens. It said that the college donated 50 samples of masks and bottles of sanitizers respectively to the Federal Ministry of Health. Explaining how the college achieved the feat, Emaimo said different departments of the school produced different items. According to him, the college’s Biomedical Engineering Department produced the ventilators, pharmacists produced the sanitizers, while entrepreneurship department produced the masks and face shields.
