Meristem Value Index added Dangote Sugar Plc and Total Nigeria Plc and removed Cadbury Nigeria Plc, Dangote Cement Plc, Fidelity Bank Plc and UACN Property Development Company Plc. According to the exchange, the indices were developed to allow investors to follow market movements and properly manage investment portfolios. Designed using the market capitalisation methodology, the indices are rebalanced on a semi-annual basis on the first business day in January and in July. The NSE began publishing the NSE 30 Index in February 2009 with index values available from January 1, 2007. On July 1, 2008, the NSE developed five sectoral indices with a base value of 1,000 points, designed to provide investable benchmarks to capture the performance of specific sectors. In July 2012, the Nigerian bourse launched the NSE Lotus Islamic Index which consists of companies whose business practices are in conformity with Shariâ€™ah Investment Principles, with the aim of increasing the breadth of the market and creating an important benchmark for investments as the alternative ethical and noninterest investment space widened.
