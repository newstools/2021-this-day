Emirates has partnered with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to become one of the first airlines in the world to try the IATA Travel Pass – a mobile app to help passengers easily and securely manage their travel in line with any government requirements for COVID-19 testing or vaccine information. The IATA Travel Pass enables Emirates’ passengers to create a ‘digital passport’ to verify their pre travel test or vaccination meets the requirements of the destination. They will also be able to share the test and vaccination certificates with authorities and airlines to facilitate travel.
The new app will also enable travellers manage all travel documentation digitally and seamlessly throughout the travel experience. Prior to a full roll out, Emirates will implement phase 1 in Dubai for the validation of COVID-19 PCR tests before departure. In this initial phase, expected to begin in April, Emirates customers travelling from Dubai will be able to share their COVID-19 test status directly with the airline even before reaching the airport through the app, which will then auto-populate the details on the check-in system. Emirates’ Chief Operating Officer, Adel Al Redha said: “While international travel remains as safe as ever, there are new protocols and travel requirements with the current global pandemic. “We have worked with IATA on this innovative solution to simplify and digitally transmit the information that is required by countries and governments into our airline systems, in a secure and efficient manner.
“We are proud to be one of the first airlines in the world to pilot this initiative, which will provide an enhanced customer experience and conveniently facilitate our customers’ travel needs.”
