A private media organisation, the Niger Delta Connect (NDC), has enjoined youths in the Niger Delta to deploy community reporting and citizen journalism for the growth and development of the region. The Acting Editor-in-Chief of the NDC, Mr. Rex-Michael Adamu, made the call during the weekend at the inaugural training programme for youths from oil-producing states on community reporting and citizen journalism, which was held in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. Adamu said the aim of the programme was to make youths get involved in discussions of topical issues affecting the region. He said: “We want the youths to be at the centre of the discussion, and we want informed discussions, which can only be possible through citizen’s participation in media reporting. “People are at the heart of media reporting and it is time to give them a microphone and amplify their voices.” Adamu said the programme was designed as a biannual event to equip young people of the Niger Delta region with skills, resources, and technical support needed to produce compelling reports about the region. “The NDC as a media platform will stand as a voice of and about the Niger Delta Region, aggregating, producing and distributing news and information items daily from all the states in the Niger Delta region by local reporters for Nigeria and international public,” he said. The training, which was supported by the Solalina Media, would ensure that youths interested in journalism were equipped to produce high-quality and engaging stories that focused on issues, culture and politics, among others about the region. The sessions were facilitated by international journalists and media professionals. Speaking on the training, the Chairman and CEO of Solalina Media, Mr. Moses Oruaze Dickson, stated that the programme would play a part in reshaping the narrative of the region and positively highlight the Niger Delta beyond oil and militancy.
