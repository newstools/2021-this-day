We hereby call on the Party leaders, members and other Kwarans of good conscience to sustain their supports for our performing Governor,” the group said. On the forthcoming membership registration, the local government Party Chairmen commended the National Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) for putting all necessary machinery in motion to ensure the success of the exercise. “While we commend our National leadership for taking the right steps to permanently return peace to Kwara APC, we appreciate their deligence in putting all machinery in motion to ensure the success of this exercise. We therefore call on our members, old and intending ones to avail themselves the rare opportunity of the registration to fully own the Party in their respective areas by encouraging as many people to join the party,” the chairmen said.
