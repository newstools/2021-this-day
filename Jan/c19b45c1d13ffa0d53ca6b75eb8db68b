•Tested war general, Irabor, becomes CDS
•Changes made to inject fresh ideas into system, says presidency
•National Assembly, Afenifere, ACF, others welcome new appointments By Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Kingsley Nwezeh, Onyebuchi Ezigbo, Adedayo Akinwale, Udora Orizu in Abuja, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos, John Shiklam in Kaduna, George Okoh in Makurdi President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday injected fresh vigour into efforts by his administration to combat insurgency, banditry and other forms of criminality with the appointment of new service chiefs. Buhari’s media adviser, Mr. Femi Adesina, in a statement that announced the appointments, named tested insurgency war general, Maj. Gen. Lucky Irabor as the new Chief of Defence Staff (CDS); Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru as Chief of Army Staff; Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo as the Chief of Naval Staff; while Air-Vice Marshal Isiaka Amao emerged the Chief of Air Staff. Their appointments followed the resignations and retirements of their predecessors who had come under severe attacks, leading to mounting pressure on the president to drop them, over their perceived inability to tame the nation’s worsening insecurity. Those who retired are the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Abayomi Olonisakin; Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai; Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok Ekwe Ibas; and Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar. Yesterday’s appointments, described by analysts as a sign of the president bowing to pressure to replace the service chiefs in a bid to combat insecurity attracted kudos and knocks from groups and organisations, including the Senate; the House of Representatives; Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF); pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere; All Progressives Congress (APC); Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF); and the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC). The presidency also said the new appointments were carried out in a bid to inject fresh ideas into the system. The statement quoted the president as congratulating the new service chiefs, urging them to be loyal and dedicated in the discharge of their responsibilities. Buhari also accepted the immediate resignations of the service chiefs and their retirements from service. He thanked them for what he called their “overwhelming achievements in our efforts at bringing enduring peace to our dear country” and wished them well in their future endeavours. Adesina shed more light on the appointments while featuring on a television programme last night, saying that the president felt it was the best time to rejig the security system in the country. “The president knew the time to do it and I believe the time has come and that is why it has been done,” he said. He faulted claims that their resignations were a result of security failures under their tenure or due to the pressure mounted on the government to sack the service chiefs. “I don’t think it is a matter of right or wrong,” Adesina said when asked to clarify the situation, adding: “It is just a matter of doing what is best for the country at the best time.” He explained: “It will not be right to say one side was right or one side was wrong because the president even in the statement we issued also commended the outgoing service chiefs for their contributions to engendering a safer country. “That shows that by and large, he was satisfied with their performances and he just felt it was time to rejig the system; have fresh energy, have fresh blood, have fresh ideas.”
The Senate welcomed the new appointments, saying Buhari’s action is in tandem with its earlier resolutions to replace the service chiefs. Senate spokesman, Senator Ajibola Basiru, told THISDAY yesterday that the change in the service chiefs was in line with two earlier resolutions of the Senate for the nation’s security to be overhauled. He said: “It is an honourable thing for the CDS and other service chiefs to have resigned and give room for fresh blood and you know that in the past, we had called for the realignment of the security network of the country and the need to inject a new set of leadership into the military.” He urged the new service chiefs to work towards tackling all the security challenges facing the nation, especially the insurgency in the North-east and banditry in some parts of the country. The Senate Minority Caucus said the appointment of the new service chiefs was better late than not coming at all. Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, said: “It is better late than never. We had been calling for this for a long time now; let’s hope this team will stem the tide of insecurity.” The House of Representatives also lauded Buhari for finally heeding the calls of the National Assembly and Nigerians by replacing the service chiefs. The House, since its inauguration, has been clamouring for the replacement of the service chiefs due to their failure to curb the worsening insecurity in the country.
The House, in two previous resolutions, had asked the president to sack the service chiefs if they failed to resign. However, their resolutions were ignored by Buhari until yesterday. Speaking to THISDAY yesterday, House spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu, described the appointment of the new service chiefs as a reflection of leadership that listens. Kalu noted that the coming on board of the new service chiefs is an injection of new energy, which though may not be automatically magical but is still a good step towards combating insecurity. While appealing to Nigerians to manage their expectations from the new service chiefs, he urged everyone to support them. He said: ”For the House of Representatives, it is a reflection of the leadership that listens. On our part, we’ve shown that we pay attention to wishes, desires, hunger and the need of the Nigerian people. What they actually wanted is what we have carried on our shoulders and presented at the plenary as their representatives.” The ruling APC also expressed confidence that the new service chiefs will consolidate on the remarkable achievements of their predecessors in keeping the country safe and peaceful.
The National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement yesterday, said the ruling party welcomed the appointments. It urged increased synergy among the armed forces in achieving these tasks. The PDP described the replacement of the service chiefs as belated, adding that much harm had already been done to national security. The party said the belated replacement showed that Buhari is a leader who has always refused to heed to wise counsel by well-meaning Nigerians. Its National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, said: “If Mr. President had acted when our party and other well-meaning Nigerians, including the two chambers of the National Assembly impressed it upon him to do so, the security situation in the country would not have degenerated to this abysmal level.” PDP, however, expressed the hope that the new service chiefs will brace up to the challenges.
ACF spokesman, Mr. Emmanuel Yawe, commended Buhari for finally heeding the calls to sack the service chiefs. “Indeed, they had overstayed their welcome; I understand that some junior officers were retired prematurely because the service chiefs refused to move out of the way. I think the country is better for it,” he said. General Secretary of NLC, Mr. Emma Ugbaja, told THISDAY that Nigerians expect the new leadership of the armed forces to rise to the occasion and ensure that they win back the confidence of the people by frontally tackling insecurity. “We expect that the new people will bring new impetus to their job. The new army chiefs included tested hands in real combat activities. We expect them to help us restore stability in our security to enable workers to go to work much more freely and to enable Nigerians not to embark on deaths trips each time they set out to go to work or travel. Rather let it be that people will go out and expect to come back safely to meet their loved ones,” he said. Spokesman of Afenifere, Mr. Yinka Odumakin, also told THISDAY that the replacement of the service chiefs at this moment is belated and not impressive. “The action does not in way invalidate the invidious agenda that brought about the unusual situation we have just passed through. It is not lost on us that the South-east for instance has nobody in the new service chiefs,” he said. PANDEF welcomed the appointments, saying it is long overdue. PANDEF’s National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Ken Robinson, stated that the group commended the president for finally responding to calls by well-meaning Nigerians to replace them. “We congratulate the new service chiefs while hoping that they will discharge their duties and responsibilities professionally, without biases and tendencies, in the best interest of the country,” he stated. But the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) faulted the composition of the new security chiefs, saying it’s lacking in proper representation. Special Assistant to the CAN president, Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, said the replacements though belated, is a welcome one. Oladeji, in a text sent to THISDAY, however, said the only concern about the composition is the absence of any Igbo extraction among them. “President Muhammadu Buhari did well by replacing the service chiefs with new ones though belatedly. It is a case of better be late than never. Their prolonged tenure has cost the nation a lot in terms of security. Hopefully, the new ones will be able to inject the long-awaited confidence, hope and new ideas. Security architecture needs a total overhauling as the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and other well-meaning Nigerians have been calling for. “The new service chiefs should bring in new helmsmen to other security agencies such as the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) and other related para-military organisations. “Our concern about the new security chiefs is the absence of any Igbo extraction among them. It is the status quo ante on the composition,” the CAN stated. The former President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo, however, condemned the non-appointment of an Igbo officer as a service chief. “Gen. Buhari thanks for making us in Igboland feel once more that we are not fit to head any of the security services,” he said. Lucky Irabor (CDS) Maj. Gen.
