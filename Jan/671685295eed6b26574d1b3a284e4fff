By Adedayo Akinwale The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives has said that while the out gone year 2020 came with lots of challenges, especially with the dreaded Coronavirus pandemic, Nigeria was further worsened by a poor, dwindling economy and insecurity occasioned by an inept leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) The Leader of the Caucus, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, in a new year message yesterday titled, “We Must Remain Resilient and Patriotic,” said no doubt, 2021 new year celebration is devoid of the usual pomp and glamour- no thanks to the numerous challenges that Nigerians had to, and are still facing. He stated: “As we are all aware, new year celebration is observed globally to mark the beginning of every new year, offering us amongst other things, new belief, new hopes, new goals, new objectives and new aspirations. “However, the 2021 New year celebrations appears less unique particularly because the out gone year 2020 came with lots of challenges, especially when the entire world had to battle with the dreaded Corona Virus (Covid-19) pandemic which led to the death of millions of friends and loved ones across the globe, including in Nigeria. “Our situation in Nigeria was further worsened by a poor and dwindling economy (now in the worst recession ever); several incidents of kidnappings, killings and general insecurity across the county, occasioned by an inept, visionless, clueless and failed leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) led Federal Government.” Chinda however urged Nigerians, as a people and as good citizens, that beyond the merriment and ecstasy that comes with it, they must remain resilient and patrotic and reflect deeply on the principles of humility, self sacrifice, good neighbourliness, including love for one another and for the country. The caucus also called on all to stay safe, especially in the wake of resurgence in the number of Covid-19 cases by observing basic health tips such as; social distancing, wearing of face/nose masks, self isolation, regular hand washing, use of alcohol based hand sanitisers as well as complying with all rules and regulations issued by government at various levels.
