The National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Dr. Sani Aliyu, has said the date for school resumption remains January 18. Speaking during a television programme yesterday, Aliyu said the date has not been changed pending further directives. On Monday, the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, had said the federal government is considering shifting the January 18 resumption date over rising COVID-19 cases. He said there were concerns about the scheduled date, adding that the federal government might review it. But Aliyu said no decision had been taken on the date, saying January 18, 2021 remains intact. “As regards schools, I just want to make a clarification. What the minister said yesterday was that they were going to review; he didn’t say that they were going to change the date. He said they will review the situation and let the nation know,” Aliyu said. “So, for the moment, it is still January 18 until the Ministry of Education comes back either with an alternative date or re-confirm that.” Nigeria has recorded a total number of 101,331 confirmed cases with 80,491 patients discharged while 1,361 have died.”
