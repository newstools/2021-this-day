By Dr. Kemi Ailoje The society at large places passionate premium on procreation in any family setting such that in most cases, the woman’s place in marriage remains precarious till confirmed through child bearing. Awoman has to prove her womanhood in same fashion. Children are held as sources of pride and strength being equated to the male progeny. Infertility therefore entails a loss thought to be tangible and therefore impacts negatively on a couple’s mental and social wellbeing. Infertility constitutes a crisis in the affected African family. The attendant emotional, psychological, cultural and social burdens drain the couple of self-belief and esteem. The unsolicited and often inpatient societal demands and expectations places such couples under unimaginable pressure and tension. They may become isolated and neglected consequent upon the attendant social stigmatization. In some cases, the female is held responsible for virtually all cases of infertility. The men folk are held as above the board. Consequent upon this, the woman is humiliated, isolated, derided, abused and rebuffed. Undergoing such life crisis has been the stories of most infertile women. It has been reported that they go to varying lengths visiting orthodox medical practitioners, herbalists, traditionalists and spiritualists in search of needed reprieve and solution while others visit clinics for regular counseling without the financial ability to go through recommended treatment thus compounding more burden in fertility clinics. It is against this backdrop that we have chosen to look at the above topic: Depression and Infertility The description above is very similar to what lots of women or couple face daily and these may often lead to frustration and depression. Most often women/couple faced with depression due to infertility may not even realize it. Depressive state has been reported to impact negatively on fertility as well, hence compounding the already existing issues.
