By Adibe Emenyonu The Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) in Edo State Wednesday directed all primary school teachers in the state to shun the February 1, 2021 resumption date proposed by the state government. The leadership of the union gave the order in a statement in Benin City, signed by the state Chairman, Mr. Pius Okhueleigbe, and the Assistant Secretary General Moni Mike Modesty Itua, The union had on January 12, 2021 directed all primary school teachers and school heads to embark on an indefinite strike with effect from January 18, 2021 over the inability of government to pay. The union in reaction to the state governmentâ€™s request to suspend the strike, noted that the state government has not demonstrated any reasonable commitment to resolve the issues presented to it. A statement, signed by the Permanent Secretary, Establishments for Edo State, D.O. Enakhimion and Head of Service, Anthony Okungbowa, appealed to the union to suspend the ongoing strike and give considerable time to create opportunity for government to dialogue with the union with a view to resolving the issues. In its response, the NUT State Wing Executive Council (SWEC), in an enlarged meeting, resolved that the indefinite strike started on January 18, 2021 and must continue. The statement said the decision to continue with the strike was because the union was convinced that it had earlier allowed the state government eight weeks to have its demands met before the commencement of the strike. It added that it was no longer disposed to request for additional days from the Edo State Government. The union therefore unanimously agreed that dialogue/negotiation between the state government and it should continue while the strike persists.
