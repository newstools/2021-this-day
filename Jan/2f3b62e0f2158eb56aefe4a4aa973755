Adibe Emenyonu in Benin City Edo, Delta, Ondo and Ekiti States are poised to get at least 90,870 metres in a new drive to improve power supply, the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) has disclosed. BEDC’s Head of Public Affairs, Mr Tayo Adekule disclosed the plan in a statement he issued in Benin City yesterday, saying the National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) allocated the metres to the BEDC. Adekule noted that the metres would be distributed under the National Mass Metering programme (NMMP) starting from Edo. He said the planned metering “will cover three other BEDC franchise states in a phase manner on a selected distribution transformer covering 90,870 customers over a period of six months.” He explained that out of the total number of meters allocated to BEDC, Edo would get 40,995, Delta 22,247, Ondo 19,453 and Ekiti 8,294. “The meters will be distributed through the BEDC Meter Asset Provider (MAP) for its franchise areas. Metering under this scheme is free and customers will not have to pay,” BEDC’s spokesperson further stated. He, however, said that all premises had to be enumerated and would be certified by the electricity inspectors before installation of the meters.
