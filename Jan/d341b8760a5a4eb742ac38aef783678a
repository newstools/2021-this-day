A Federal High Court sitting in Lagos State has admitted more exhibits in evidence in the ongoing trial of hip-hop singer Azeez Fashola, popularly known as ‘Naira Marley.’ Justice Nicolas Oweibo in his ruling yesterday admitted the Compact Disk containing the phone analysis of the singer, tendered in evidence by the second prosecution witness, Mr. Anosike Augustine on the ground that the iPhone which was analysed has been admitted in evidence before. The judge overruled the objection of Naira Marley’s counsel, Mr. Olalekan Ojo (SAN) and admitted the CD in evidence marked exhibit ‘F.’ “l have considered the agreement of both parties as well as the ground for the objection, I consider the CD to be admissible in view of the nature of this case and the evidence of other prosecution witness,” Oweibo said. The trial of the case could not proceed because the defence counsel, Olalekan Ojo, was not in court and sought an adjournment. The adjournment was not opposed by the EFCC’s counsel, Bilkisu Buhari. Justice Oweibo adjourned the further trial to the 8th and 11th of March, 2021. Recall that the anti-graft agency had on May 20, 2019, arraigned Naira Marley on 11 counts of money laundering and Internet fraud. The EFCC alleged that some of the credit cards discovered in his residence bore the names Nicole Louise Malyon and Timea Fedorne Tatar. But he pleaded not guilty to all the charges. The EFCC said that the offences contravenes Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act and the Cyber Crimes Act.
