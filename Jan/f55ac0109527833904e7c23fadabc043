There has been so much sad and bad news lately that any change would be appreciated even dumb news and not just the Giuliani four seasons landscaping press conference. Fortunately, a local newspaper provides just such a story suggesting that students who spend four or more hours every night online or playing games do not do as well in tests. As a retired teacher I can confirm that subjectively but not objectively and that is the problem with this investigation. There are many items in the news that may appear sensible or accurate but without evidence or confirmable quotes they probably should not be published. This does not apply to celebrity magazines that seem very creative and avoid the truth, mainly because it is boring. Given the difficult times we are going through, for almost a year already, we need reliable, accurate reporting although the occasional dumb story does help get through the day. Dennis Fitzgerald,
