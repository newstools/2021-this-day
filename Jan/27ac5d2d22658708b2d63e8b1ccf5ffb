The domestic wing of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos, known as the General Aviation Terminal One (GAT) recorded over five million passengers between July and December, 2020. This was disclosed by the Terminal Manager, Mr. Adekunle Aderibigbe, who said passenger traffic was low during the period, but picked up during the Yuletide celebrations despite the effects of the pandemic. He added that the airlines were up to their game in deploying more aircraft to handle the passenger upsurge. Aderibigbe explained that safety, security and comfort of passengers remained the priority of FAAN, especially in compliance with the COVID-19 protocols. He, however, stated that the major challenge faced by the airport staff was dealing with travellers who refuse to comply with the protocols, saying despite the evidence of deaths caused by coronavirus, some people still believe the virus canâ€™t kill Nigerians. He added that a team had been constituted to enforce compliance to ensure that passengers abide by the COVID-19 protocol at the terminal. Aderibigbe said the airport had been cleared of unwanted visitors especially to avoid bottlenecks on the access roads, stressing that arriving passengers board their vehicles at the terminal car park. He also applauded airlines for their insistence on passengers buying their tickets online, adding that this had led to a reduction in touting in the terminal, a development he said was welcomed.
